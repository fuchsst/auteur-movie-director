# Break Down Epic into User Stories

Decomposes epics into implementable user stories using the Development Lead persona and BMAD story breakdown methodology.

$ARGUMENTS: epic_name, story_size_target (small/medium/large), sprint_capacity

## Task
Transform epic requirements into a set of well-defined, implementable user stories with clear acceptance criteria, proper sizing, and integration with the BMAD agent architecture.

## Development Lead Persona Application
Use the Development Lead persona from `.bmad-core/personas/development-lead.md`:
- **Technical Story Breakdown** - Decompose complex features into manageable chunks
- **Architecture Alignment** - Ensure stories fit within established addon structure  
- **Dependency Management** - Identify cross-story and cross-epic dependencies
- **Implementation Guidance** - Provide technical direction for story execution
- **Quality Standards** - Define technical acceptance criteria and validation approach

## Story Breakdown Framework
```markdown
# User Story: {story_title}

## Story Description
**As a** [Blender user/filmmaker/content creator]
**I want** [specific functionality]
**So that** [business value within generative film workflow]

## Acceptance Criteria
### Functional Requirements
- [ ] Core functionality works as specified
- [ ] Integration with relevant film crew agents
- [ ] Blender UI follows established patterns
- [ ] Backend service integration is functional

### Technical Requirements  
- [ ] Code follows addon architecture standards
- [ ] Agent integration uses CrewAI framework properly
- [ ] Custom properties integrate with asset data model
- [ ] Workflow templates are properly configured

### Quality Requirements
- [ ] Unit tests cover core functionality
- [ ] Integration tests validate agent interaction
- [ ] UI tests verify Blender addon behavior
- [ ] Documentation is complete and accurate

## Implementation Notes
### Technical Approach
- Blender addon components required (panels, operators, properties)
- Agent system integration points
- Backend service API calls needed
- Workflow template modifications required

### Dependencies
- Prerequisites from other stories
- Agent implementations required
- Backend service configurations needed
- Asset data model requirements
```

## Story Categorization
Stories are categorized by component:
- **Agent Stories** - Film crew agent implementation and enhancement
- **UI Stories** - Blender panels, operators, and Asset Browser integration
- **Backend Stories** - API client and workflow template development  
- **Data Model Stories** - Custom property and asset management features
- **Integration Stories** - Cross-component and system integration
- **Testing Stories** - Quality assurance and validation implementation

## Story Sizing Guidelines
- **Small (1-3 story points)** - Single component, minimal dependencies
- **Medium (5-8 story points)** - Multiple components, some integration
- **Large (13+ story points)** - Complex integration, multiple agents involved

## BMAD Integration Patterns
Each story must consider:
- **Film Crew Agent Integration** - Which agents are involved and how
- **Workflow Template Requirements** - ComfyUI/Wan2GP configurations needed
- **Asset Data Model Impact** - Custom property and data structure changes
- **UI Component Design** - Blender addon user experience patterns

## Story Validation Checklist
- [ ] Story is independently deliverable
- [ ] Acceptance criteria are testable
- [ ] Technical approach is feasible within sprint
- [ ] Dependencies are clearly identified
- [ ] Story aligns with epic acceptance criteria
- [ ] Implementation follows BMAD architecture patterns

- Complete story set in `.bmad-core/stories/{epic_name}/`
- Story dependency mapping
- Sprint assignment recommendations
- Technical implementation guidance
- Testing strategy for each story
