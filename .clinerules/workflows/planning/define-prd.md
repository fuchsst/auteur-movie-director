# Define Product Requirements Document

Creates a comprehensive PRD using the Business Analyst persona and BMAD methodology for Blender Movie Director features.

$ARGUMENTS: feature_name, stakeholder_input, business_justification

## Task
Analyze feature requirements and create a detailed Product Requirements Document following BMAD Business Analyst practices. Focus on the generative film studio vision and Blender addon constraints.

## Business Analyst Persona Application
Use the Business Analyst persona from `.bmad-core/personas/business-analyst.md`:
- **Requirements Gathering** - Stakeholder interviews and analysis
- **Business Value Assessment** - ROI and impact analysis for film creators
- **Technical Feasibility** - Blender addon and backend service constraints
- **User Journey Mapping** - Film production workflow integration
- **Success Metrics** - Measurable outcomes for generative film creation

## PRD Structure Template
```markdown
# Product Requirements Document: {feature_name}

## Executive Summary
- Business justification within generative film studio context
- Target user personas (filmmakers, artists, content creators)
- Expected impact on film production workflow

## Problem Statement
- Current limitations in generative film production
- Pain points in existing Blender workflows
- Gaps in agent-based film creation pipeline

## Solution Overview
- Feature description within BMAD agent framework
- Integration with existing film crew agents
- Backend service requirements (ComfyUI/Wan2GP/LiteLLM)

## User Stories & Acceptance Criteria
- Primary user workflows
- Blender addon interaction patterns
- Agent orchestration requirements

## Technical Requirements
- Blender addon architecture constraints
- CrewAI framework integration needs
- Backend API requirements
- Performance and resource considerations

## Success Metrics
- User adoption within Blender workflow
- Generative content quality improvements
- Production workflow efficiency gains
```

## Integration with BMAD Architecture
PRD must align with:
- **Film Crew Agent Metaphor** - Feature integration with existing agents
- **Blender Native Design** - Seamless addon experience
- **Local-First Architecture** - Backend service coordination
- **Asset Data Model** - Generative asset lifecycle management

## Business Analysis Focus Areas
- **User Value Proposition** - How feature enhances generative film creation
- **Technical Feasibility** - Blender addon and backend integration complexity  
- **Resource Requirements** - Development effort and infrastructure needs
- **Risk Assessment** - Technical and adoption risks
- **Success Criteria** - Measurable outcomes and validation methods

## Output Artifacts
- Complete PRD document in `.bmad-core/prds/{feature_name}.md`
- Stakeholder sign-off and approval
- Technical feasibility assessment
- Development effort estimation
- Integration requirements specification
