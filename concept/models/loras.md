## FLUX

### UnFlux

https://civitai.com/models/1732024/unflux?modelVersionId=1960272

Model Type: LoRA
Trained On: Flux Kontext (via AI Toolkit)
Best Results With: Flux Dev (T2I / I2I modes)
Trigger Word: unflux this
Purpose: Remove unnatural anatomical exaggerations and synthetic skin effects generated by Flux

Note: Even though this LoRA was trained in Flux Kontext, the results obtained with better quality in my opinion are using it together with Flux Dev through T2I or I2I.

in I2I using Flux Dev I liked the result when using the sampler: gradient_estimation, deis_3m, euler, ddim, seeds3, ipndm or another one you want and most importantly the scheduler: kl_optimal, ddim_uniform or normal, for the kl_optimal it allows you to increase the denoise and have more subtle changes in the input image, so even using a very high denoise like 0.87 it will still change little in the reference image.

Recreates the iconic teal-green look from The Matrix (1999) with desaturated skin tones, cyan shadows, and subtle film grain. Ideal for cyberpunk, noir, war, dystopian sci-fi, or 90s-inspired scenes. Best at 1.0 strength.
