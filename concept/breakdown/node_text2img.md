# **An Architectural and Implementation Specification for the Text-to-Image Node**

## **Introduction**

The Text-to-Image node serves as a cornerstone of the Generative Media Studio's creative capabilities. It is the primary interface for translating abstract creative intent, articulated as text prompts, into concrete visual assets. This component is not a standalone tool but an integral part of a larger, orchestrated system engineered for professional, iterative, and scalable media production.1 The node's functionality is governed by the studio's core architectural principles: a decoupled client-server model that separates the user interface from the computational engine, a non-destructive workflow that preserves creative history through integrated version control, and a modular, containerized backend known as the "Function Runner" pattern.1

This document provides the definitive, full-stack technical specification for the Text-to-Image node. Its purpose is to serve as a single source of truth for the engineering team, detailing every aspect of the component from its user-facing representation on the Production Canvas down to the granular mechanics of its containerized execution environment. It will trace the complete lifecycle of a generation request, establishing the data contracts, UI specifications, backend flows, and operational blueprints required for its implementation, maintenance, and future extension.

## **Section 1: The Node Data Contract and Base Structure**

The foundation of the node-based system is a rigorously defined "grammar" that governs the structure of nodes and the flow of data between them. This is not merely a set of conventions but a strict contract that ensures both user-facing consistency and the operational reliability of the automated backend processes.

### **1.1. Common Node Anatomy: A Unified Structural Specification**

The standardized structure of each node is a functional requirement for the system's agentic backend framework. For the backend to programmatically parse, interpret, and reliably execute the workflows defined in a project's project.json manifest, it requires a predictable and standardized schema for every node on the canvas.1 The principle that "Relying on user discipline to maintain a folder structure is guaranteed to fail" applies with equal force to the node graph, which represents the "source code" of the generative process.1 Therefore, this common anatomy serves as the API contract for the node graph itself, where any deviation constitutes a breaking change.

Based on the platform's UI/UX architecture, every node is a self-contained Svelte component adhering to the following structure 1:

* **Header:** A distinct top section that displays the node's human-readable title (e.g., "Text-to-Image") and a machine-readable type identifier (e.g., node\_type: 'text\_to\_image'). This identifier is used by the backend to dispatch the correct execution logic.  
* **Connection Ports (Sockets):** Standardized circular points on the left for inputs and on the right for outputs. Each socket is strictly typed to enforce valid connections at the UI level, preventing logical errors before a task is ever submitted.1  
* **Preview Area:** A designated rectangular region for displaying a thumbnail of the node's most recent output. This provides immediate visual feedback, a core tenet of the user experience, allowing artists to assess results at a glance without needing to open a separate viewer.1  
* **State Indicators:** A system of visual cues, such as colored borders or icons, designed to communicate the node's real-time operational state. These indicators provide crucial, at-a-glance feedback on backend processes, displaying states like "processing" (e.g., a pulsing blue border), "completed" (green border), "error" (red border), or "out-of-sync" if an upstream dependency has changed.1  
* **On-Node Controls:** A minimal set of the most essential parameters or action buttons that can be manipulated directly on the canvas. This is designed for rapid, high-frequency interactions, such as tweaking a prompt and clicking a "Generate" button, without requiring the user to shift focus to a separate properties panel.1

### **1.2. The Data Type System: Enforcing Logical Data Flow**

The typed connection system functions as a form of static analysis at the user interface level. By programmatically preventing invalid connections—for instance, connecting an Image output to a String input—it preempts an entire class of runtime errors that would otherwise manifest on the backend. A "Function Runner" executing a model like FLUX has strict expectations for its inputs: a text prompt must be a string, and a CFG scale value must be a floating-point number.2 Allowing arbitrary connections would inevitably lead to malformed data payloads and difficult-to-debug task failures.

The Svelte Flow frontend implementation acts as a gatekeeper, using the type property of each input and output socket to validate connections before they can be made.1 This architectural choice shifts error detection from a late-stage, backend runtime problem to an early-stage, frontend design-time prevention, which is a hallmark of a robust and user-friendly system. The following table formally defines the data types that constitute the "language" of data flow within the application, synthesizing the core list from the UI/UX analysis with additional types required by the specified generative models.1

| Socket Data Type | Underlying Representation | Description & Rationale | Example Use Case |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **String** | string | A standard UTF-8 text string. The most fundamental data type for textual parameters. | Used for text prompts, labels, filenames, and descriptive metadata. 1 |
| **Integer** | number (integer) | A whole number. Used for parameters that require discrete, non-fractional values. | Seed values, step counts, frame numbers, iteration counts. 1 |
| **Float** | number (float) | A floating-point number. Essential for parameters requiring decimal precision. | CFG scale, LoRA weights, denoising strength, scale factors. 1 |
| **Boolean** | boolean | A true/false value. Used for toggles and flags to enable or disable features or pathways. | A toggle to enable/disable a refiner model or an upscaling pass. 1 |
| **Image** | string (relative file path) | A relative path to a raster image file (e.g., PNG, JPG) within the project structure. | Connecting an image source to an Image-to-Image or Inpainting node. 1 |
| **Video** | string (relative file path) | A relative path to a video file (e.g., MP4) within the project structure. | Connecting a video source to an editing node like FaceSwap or QualityImprovement. 1 |
| **Audio** | string (relative file path) | A relative path to an audio file (e.g., WAV, MP3) within the project structure. | Providing a dialogue track to a LipSync node. 1 |
| **AssetReference** | string (UUID) | A universally unique identifier pointing to a complex "Generative Asset" (e.g., a Character). This is a high-level abstraction. The backend uses this UUID to look up the asset's full definition and associated file paths (LoRA model, reference images, etc.). | Connecting a 'Character' AssetNode to a ShotNode to ensure identity preservation. 1 |
| **ControlMap** | string (relative file path) | A path to a specialized image used for conditioning a diffusion model, such as a depth map, Canny edge map, or pose skeleton. | Connecting a pose-detection node's output to a ControlNet-enabled generation node. 1 |
| **Mask** | string (relative file path) | A path to a grayscale image used for inpainting, outpainting, or masking operations. White areas indicate regions to be modified. | Providing a mask to an EditImagePart node to define the area to be regenerated. 1 |
| **PipelineReference** | string (UUID or unique name) | An identifier for a specific backend generative pipeline configuration (e.g., a ComfyUI workflow JSON or a named "Function Runner" strategy). This decouples the on-canvas node from a specific implementation. | Connecting a PipelineNode to a ShotNode to specify that it should be rendered using the "cinematic-v2" pipeline. 1 |

## **Section 2: The Text-to-Image Node: A User-Facing Specification**

This section provides the definitive specification for the Text-to-Image node's user interface and interactive behavior. It follows a progressive disclosure design pattern, where the on-canvas node presents an optimized interface for the most common interactions, while the Properties Inspector provides comprehensive control over all parameters.1

### **2.1. Canvas Representation**

The on-canvas representation of the Text-to-Image node is designed for efficiency and immediate feedback, providing access to the most critical functions without cluttering the workspace. The structural principles from the Generate Video from Image Node are applied here to the TextToImage node specified in the platform's architecture.1

* **Title:** The header prominently displays "Text-to-Image".  
* **Default Input Sockets:**  
  * Prompt (String): For connecting a text output from another node, enabling programmatic prompt construction.  
  * Negative Prompt (String): For connecting a shared or dynamically generated negative prompt.  
  * Style (AssetReference): An optional input for connecting a Style asset, which applies a consistent aesthetic to the generation.  
  * Character (AssetReference): An optional input for connecting a Character asset, used to invoke a trained LoRA or other identity-preserving model to ensure character consistency.  
* **Default Output Sockets:**  
  * Output (Image): Provides the relative file path to the generated image, allowing it to be wired as an input to subsequent nodes (e.g., an Upscale or EditImage node).  
* **On-Node UI Elements:**  
  * A multi-line text area is provided directly on the node for inputting the positive prompt. As this is the most frequently modified parameter, its immediate accessibility is a key UX requirement.1  
  * A thumbnail preview area displays the last successfully generated "Take," providing instant visual confirmation of the node's output.1  
  * A primary "Generate" button triggers the entire backend execution flow.1  
  * A progress indicator, such as a spinner overlay or a progress bar, activates on the node during generation to provide real-time feedback on the task's status.1

### **2.2. The Properties Inspector Panel**

When the Text-to-Image node is selected on the canvas, the right-hand Properties Inspector panel dynamically populates with a comprehensive set of controls. This panel is the central hub for detailed parameter tuning and for managing the node's iterative history via the "Takes" system. It is the UI manifestation of the platform's non-destructive, parameter-driven workflow.1 The available controls are informed by the parameters of advanced diffusion models like FLUX and the established UIs of tools like ComfyUI and Google's Vertex AI.2

| UI Section | UI Element | Type | Description & Rationale |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Generation** | **Positive Prompt** | Text Area | A large, multi-line input for the main descriptive prompt. This mirrors the on-node control but provides more space for complex prompts. 1 |
|  | **Negative Prompt** | Text Area | A multi-line input for terms to be excluded from the image, a standard feature in diffusion models. 4 |
|  | **Generate Button** | Button | The primary action button to initiate the backend generation task. Labeled "Generate" or "Execute". 1 |
| **Parameters** | **Seed** | Integer Input | The random seed for generation. Allows for reproducible results. A "randomize" button should be adjacent. 1 |
|  | **Steps** | Slider/Integer Input | The number of denoising steps for the diffusion process. More steps can increase detail but also generation time. 1 |
|  | **CFG Scale** | Slider/Float Input | Classifier-Free Guidance scale. Controls how strongly the model adheres to the prompt. 1 |
|  | **Dimensions** | Dropdown/Inputs | Presets for aspect ratio (e.g., "16:9", "1:1") and fields for custom width/height in pixels. 3 |
| **Takes Gallery** | **Takes Grid** | Thumbnail Grid | A scrollable grid displaying all previously generated images ("Takes") for this node. The active take is highlighted. Clicking a thumbnail selects it as the current output. This is the core of the iterative workflow. 1 |
|  | **Active Take Info** | Text Display | Displays the filename of the selected take (e.g., SHOT-010\_v01\_take03.png). |
| **Cross-Links** | **Input Assets** | Link List | A list of connected assets (e.g., "Character: Alex", "Style: Noir"). Each is a clickable link that selects the corresponding AssetNode on the canvas, enabling rapid dependency navigation. 1 |
|  | **Output File** | Link | A clickable link to the final output file in the project's 03\_Renders directory, allowing the user to open it directly. |

## **Section 3: The End-to-End Backend Execution Flow**

This section traces the complete lifecycle of a generation request, detailing the orchestrated interaction between the system's distributed components, from the initial user click to the final result.

### **3.1. Task Initiation and Dispatch (Client → API Gateway)**

The execution flow is initiated when a user clicks the "Generate" button on the Text-to-Image node.1 This action does not trigger a conventional HTTP request. Instead, the SvelteKit frontend dispatches a

client:start\_generation message over the persistent WebSocket connection that has been established for the active project (e.g., at the endpoint /ws/{project\_id}).1 The payload for this message is minimal, containing the unique

node\_id of the Text-to-Image node that initiated the request.

The FastAPI backend, serving as the system's API gateway, receives this WebSocket message. The endpoint handler for this event acts as an intelligent "Producer" or "Dispatcher Agent," performing critical pre-processing before queuing the task. Upon receiving the node\_id, the backend retrieves the full data for that node (prompts, seed, CFG scale, etc.) from the project's current state, which is maintained in memory or a fast-access store like Redis.

Crucially, the dispatcher then reads the project-wide quality setting ('low', 'standard', or 'high') from the project.json manifest.1 It consults its internal configuration—the "Quality Level to Pipeline Mapping"—to translate this user-facing setting into a concrete technical execution plan, selecting the appropriate backend pipeline (e.g., the Docker image

t2i-flux-dev-fp16:latest for a 'high' quality request).1 This is also the stage where hardware-aware orchestration occurs. The dispatcher logic is designed to be aware of the VRAM capabilities of the available worker pools. It can verify that a suitable worker is available for the requested quality tier and, if not, either queue the task for the appropriate hardware or trigger a fallback to a lower-quality pipeline, notifying the user of the change. This intelligent dispatching ensures that user intent is translated into a resource-aware technical plan that maximizes system stability and reliability.1

### **3.2. Asynchronous Task Queuing (API Gateway → Broker → Worker)**

Once the execution plan is formulated, the FastAPI endpoint invokes the corresponding Celery task using the .delay() or .apply\_async() method.5 This call passes a comprehensive payload to the task, including the user's prompts, all generation parameters (seed, CFG, etc.), the unique identifier for the selected pipeline, and the deterministically generated output path for the new "Take" within the project's

03\_Renders/ directory.

Celery serializes this task message and places it onto the message broker, which is a Redis instance managed by the gms\_redis service.1 Redis serves as a robust and durable queue, ensuring that the task is persisted and will not be lost, even in the event of an API server or worker restart. A Celery worker process, running inside the

gms\_worker container, continuously monitors this Redis queue for new tasks. When it detects the new message, it fetches and deserializes the payload, preparing to orchestrate its execution.7 This decoupling of the API gateway from the computational worker is a fundamental architectural pattern that ensures the responsiveness of the main application and enables horizontal scaling of the generative workload.1

### **3.3. The "Function Runner" Orchestration (Worker-Side Logic)**

A critical architectural decision is that the Celery worker itself does not contain the FLUX model code or any other generative model's logic. This separation of concerns is the essence of the "Function Runner" pattern, where the worker's role is that of an orchestrator, not a direct executor.1

Upon receiving the task, the worker's logic inspects the pipeline\_id included in the payload (e.g., t2i-flux-dev-fp16:latest). The worker contains a routing mechanism, such as a Python dictionary or a switch statement, that maps these pipeline identifiers to specific execution strategies.1 For a Text-to-Image task, this ID maps to the "FLUX Container Runner" strategy. The worker's code then proceeds to dynamically construct and execute a command to launch a new, separate, and isolated Docker container based on the specified image tag.

This pattern provides profound flexibility and extensibility. To integrate a completely new generative model into the studio, an engineer only needs to package the model into a new containerized implementation and add a corresponding entry to the worker's strategy map. This can be done without modifying the core logic of the Celery worker or the FastAPI server, dramatically accelerating the platform's ability to adopt new, state-of-the-art technologies as they emerge.1

## **Section 4: The FLUX Function Runner: A Containerized Execution Deep Dive**

This section provides a low-level examination of the mechanics of generative task execution, detailing how the work is performed within an isolated, on-demand container.

### **4.1. The FLUX Docker Image Specification**

The system utilizes a series of custom-built Docker images, such as gms-flux:1.0, which are derived from a standard base image that includes Python and the necessary NVIDIA CUDA libraries (e.g., nvidia/cuda:12.4.1-runtime-ubuntu22.04).1 To accommodate different performance and quality requirements, distinct image tags are used to encapsulate specific configurations. The orchestrating Celery worker selects the appropriate image tag based on the

quality setting that was resolved by the FastAPI dispatcher and passed in the task message.1 This relationship is formalized in the following mapping.

| Quality Setting | Selected Pipeline (Docker Image:Tag) | Model Variant | Precision | Target VRAM | Key Optimizations |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Low** | gms-flux:1.0-low-vram | FLUX.1-schnell | FP8 Quantized | \~12 GB | CPU offloading, sequential processing of text encoders and UNet. 1 |
| **Standard** | gms-flux:1.0-standard | FLUX.1-dev | FP8 Quantized | \~16 GB | Moderate parallelization, optimized for common consumer GPUs. 1 |
| **High** | gms-flux:1.0-high-fidelity | FLUX.1-dev | FP16 | 24 GB+ | Full parallel execution, all features enabled for maximum quality and resolution. 1 |

### **4.2. Container Invocation and Input Management**

The Celery worker, running within the gms\_worker container, invokes the ephemeral FLUX container using a library like the Docker SDK for Python or by making a direct subprocess call to the Docker CLI. The key to enabling data access is the shared workspace volume. The worker's invocation command must re-mount the generative\_studio\_workspace named volume into the new FLUX container it is spawning. This action grants the temporary container direct, high-performance access to the entire project file system, including source assets and render directories.1

Inputs such as the prompt, seed, and other parameters are passed to the container as environment variables (-e) or command-line arguments. The Python script inside the container is designed to read these values upon startup to configure the generation pipeline.9 A conceptual invocation command constructed by the worker would look as follows:

Bash

docker run \--rm \--gpus all \\  
  \--name flux-task-a4b1c8 \\  
  \-v generative\_studio\_workspace:/workspace:rw \\  
  \-e PROMPT="A cinematic shot of a lone astronaut on a red desert planet, high detail, 4k" \\  
  \-e NEGATIVE\_PROMPT="cartoon, drawing, illustration" \\  
  \-e SEED="42" \\  
  \-e CFG\_SCALE="7.5" \\  
  \-e STEPS="30" \\  
  \-e OUTPUT\_PATH="/workspace/Projects/Project\_Odyssey/03\_Renders/SCENE\_02/SHOT\_015/SHOT-015\_v01\_take04.png" \\  
  gms-flux:1.0-high-fidelity

### **4.3. Model and Asset Access**

A crucial optimization and best practice is the separation of model data from application code. The large AI model files (e.g., .safetensors) are not baked into the Docker images. Instead, a setup script (detailed in Section 6\) downloads the required models to a standardized location within the shared workspace, such as Generative\_Studio\_Workspace/Library/AI\_Models/flux/.9 The Python execution script within the FLUX container is hardcoded to load the model from this well-defined path on the mounted

/workspace volume. This approach keeps the Docker images small and agile, allows models to be updated without rebuilding images, and enables multiple containers to share a single copy of the model files, conserving disk space.

### **4.4. Output Retrieval and Storage**

The process of retrieving the generated output is elegantly simplified by the shared volume architecture. Upon successful generation, the script inside the FLUX container saves the final image directly to the file path it received via the OUTPUT\_PATH environment variable. Because this path points to a location on the shared /workspace volume, the file is written directly to the host machine's file system (within the ./Generative\_Studio\_Workspace directory) and is immediately persisted and visible to all other services in the application stack.1

Once the file is saved, the container's script completes its execution and the container exits. The orchestrating Celery worker monitors the container's lifecycle and detects its successful termination (an exit code of 0). This signals the completion of the task. There is no need for complex data transfer mechanisms like streaming bytes over a network socket; the shared file system volume handles the data persistence implicitly and efficiently.

## **Section 5: Real-Time State and Status Management**

A critical component of the user experience for long-running generative tasks is a robust, real-time feedback loop. This is achieved through a WebSocket-based event protocol that keeps the client UI perfectly synchronized with the state of the backend task.

### **5.1. The WebSocket Event Protocol**

The WebSocket protocol is the nervous system of the application's real-time features, responsible for maintaining a synchronized state between the client and server.1 The protocol is designed to be comprehensive, handling not only binary success/failure notifications but also granular progress updates, which are essential for tasks that may take seconds or even minutes to complete. The following table defines the server-to-client communication contract for task-related events.

| Event Name | Direction | Payload Schema | Description |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| server:node\_state\_updated | S → C | { "node\_id": "...", "state": "generating" | "completed" | "error" } | Informs the client of a high-level state change for a node, used to toggle UI elements like spinners or error icons. 1 |
| server:task\_progress | S → C | { "task\_id": "...", "node\_id": "...", "progress": 50, "step": "Denoising..." } | Provides granular progress updates. The orchestrating worker parses this from the FLUX container's stdout and relays it. 1 |
| server:task\_success | S → C | { "task\_id": "...", "node\_id": "...", "result": { "output\_path": "..." } } | Sent when a task completes successfully. The payload includes the path to the new "Take", allowing the UI to update the thumbnail and "Takes" gallery. 1 |
| server:task\_failed | S → C | { "task\_id": "...", "node\_id": "...", "error": "Error message..." } | Sent when a task fails. The payload contains a human-readable error message (from the container's stderr) to be displayed to the user. 1 |

### **5.2. Worker Monitoring and Event Publishing**

The orchestrating Celery worker is responsible for monitoring the ephemeral FLUX container and publishing these status events. This is achieved through a robust, decoupled architecture.

The event generation sequence is as follows:

1. **On Task Start:** Immediately after successfully invoking the docker run command, the worker publishes a server:node\_state\_updated event with a state of "generating" to a dedicated Redis Pub/Sub channel.  
2. **During Execution:** The worker process attaches to the running FLUX container and continuously reads its standard output (stdout) stream. The container's internal script is designed to periodically print progress updates in a machine-parsable format (e.g., PROGRESS: 50 | Denoising...). The worker parses these lines and publishes corresponding server:task\_progress events to the Redis channel.  
3. **On Task End:** The worker waits for the container process to terminate.  
4. If the container exits with a code of 0, the worker knows the task was successful and the output file was created. It then publishes a server:task\_success event, including the output\_path in the payload. It also publishes a final server:node\_state\_updated event with a state of "completed".  
5. If the container exits with a non-zero code, it signifies an error. The worker captures the container's standard error (stderr) stream, formats it into a user-friendly error message, and publishes a server:task\_failed event. It follows this with a server:node\_state\_updated event with a state of "error".

The FastAPI server runs a WebSocket manager that subscribes to this Redis Pub/Sub channel. When it receives a message, it forwards it to the appropriate client's WebSocket connection based on the project ID. This architecture cleanly decouples the Celery workers from the responsibility of managing persistent WebSocket connections, making the entire system more scalable and resilient.

## **Section 6: Build and Deployment Blueprint**

This section provides the practical, actionable blueprint for building the containerized components and managing the operational lifecycle of the service.

### **6.1. Container Build Process (Dockerfile)**

The gms-flux image is constructed using a multi-stage Dockerfile to ensure the final runtime image is as lean and secure as possible, containing only the necessary artifacts for execution.1 The following is a representative

Dockerfile for the gms-flux:1.0-high-fidelity image.

ENV PATH="/opt/venv/bin:$PATH"  
USER appuser

\# Define the entrypoint for the container  
CMD \["python", "src/run\_flux\_generation.py"\]

### **6.2. Model Installation and Management**

AI models are treated as data, not code, and are therefore managed outside the container image build process.9 A dedicated Python script,

scripts/download\_models.py, is provided to handle the acquisition of model assets. This script utilizes the huggingface\_hub library to download the specified versions of the FLUX models (e.g., black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-dev) and their associated text encoders.

The script saves these large .safetensors files to a standardized location within the shared workspace: Generative\_Studio\_Workspace/Library/AI\_Models/. This process is typically run once during the initial environment setup and is invoked via a simple Makefile target, such as make download-models. This ensures that all models are in a predictable location, ready to be mounted into any Function Runner container.

### **6.3. Service Orchestration**

The application's microservices are orchestrated using Docker Compose, with a Makefile providing a simplified command-line interface for developers.1 While the primary

docker-compose.yml defines the core services (frontend, backend, worker, redis), specialized Function Runners like FLUX are defined in separate, optional compose files, such as docker-compose.flux.yml.

This file is not used for the on-demand invocation by the Celery worker but serves two purposes: it allows Docker Compose to build the gms-flux image, and it enables developers to run the service in an attached, long-running mode for direct testing and debugging. The Makefile includes a target like up-with-flux that internally executes docker-compose \-f docker-compose.yml \-f docker-compose.flux.yml up \-d, demonstrating the "simple but flexible" principle of abstracting complex orchestration commands behind memorable targets.1

## **Conclusion and Recommendations**

The architecture of the Text-to-Image node represents a robust, scalable, and extensible solution for generative media creation. By adhering to strict data contracts, employing a decoupled asynchronous backend, and leveraging the strategic flexibility of the containerized "Function Runner" pattern, the system is well-equipped to handle professional creative workflows. The non-destructive "Takes" system, coupled with real-time status feedback via WebSockets, provides a user experience that is both powerful and intuitive.

The design successfully balances immediate functional requirements with long-term strategic goals. The separation of concerns—between UI and backend, orchestrator and executor, code and data—creates a maintainable and evolvable platform.

For future development, the following expert recommendations are proposed:

1. **Implement Dynamic, Resource-Aware Scheduling:** The current hardware-aware orchestration is based on static VRAM tiers. A more advanced implementation should query worker nodes for real-time resource utilization (e.g., current VRAM usage) before dispatching a task. This would allow for more efficient packing of tasks onto available hardware, improving overall system throughput.  
2. **Transition to Cloud-Native Orchestration:** For production cloud deployments, the docker run invocation from within a Celery worker should be replaced with a more robust, cloud-native orchestration service. Using tools like Kubernetes Jobs, AWS Batch, or Google Cloud Run Jobs would provide superior fault tolerance, scalability, and management capabilities for the ephemeral Function Runner containers.  
3. **Enhance Progress Reporting:** The current progress reporting is based on parsing text from stdout. A more advanced mechanism could be implemented where the FLUX container generates and saves intermediate preview images at certain steps of the diffusion process. The server:task\_progress WebSocket event could then be augmented to include a path to this temporary preview, allowing the UI to display a "live" look at the image as it is being generated, significantly enhancing the user experience.
