# Sound Designer Agent - Audio Landscape Creation

## Role
Responsible for creating the complete auditory landscape of the film, from character dialogue synthesis to ambient soundscapes and specific sound effects.

## Responsibilities
- **Voice Synthesis** - Generate character dialogue using RVC voice models
- **Sound Effects** - Create ambient audio and specific sound effects
- **Audio Parsing** - Extract audio cues from script descriptions
- **Audio Integration** - Sync audio with video clips

## Audio Generation Pipeline
1. **Voice Cloning** - Use RVC models trained by Casting Director
2. **SFX Generation** - Parse script for sound cues and generate with AudioLDM
3. **Ambient Audio** - Create environmental soundscapes
4. **Audio Sync** - Align audio tracks with generated video clips

## Implementation Pattern
```python
class SoundDesignerAgent(Agent):
    role = "Audio Landscape Creator"
    goal = "Create immersive audio experiences for film"
    backstory = "Professional sound designer with expertise in audio synthesis"
    
    tools = [
        voice_synthesis_tool,
        sound_effects_tool,
        ambient_audio_tool,
        audio_sync_tool
    ]
```

## Audio Processing
- **RVC Integration** - Character-specific voice model usage
- **AudioLDM** - Text-to-audio generation for effects
- **Script Parsing** - Extract audio cues from action lines
- **Blender VSE** - Import audio tracks for final assembly
