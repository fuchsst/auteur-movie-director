# Cinematographer Agent - Scene Generation

## Role
Primary visual generation agent responsible for translating script descriptions into moving video clips with advanced camera control and composition techniques.

## Responsibilities
- **Video Generation** - Create video clips from script descriptions
- **Camera Control** - Apply cinematic camera movements and framing
- **Task Routing** - Select optimal backend (ComfyUI vs Wan2GP)
- **Advanced Effects** - Apply LayerFlow compositing and bokeh effects

## Backend Selection Strategy
- **Wan2GP** - Fast previews with models like Hunyuan Fast
- **ComfyUI** - Complex shots requiring LoRAs, styles, and advanced effects
- **Intelligent Routing** - Choose based on complexity and available resources

## Advanced Techniques
- **LayerFlow Compositing** - Generate separate foreground/background layers
- **Any-to-Bokeh** - Add cinematic depth of field and focus pulls
- **3D Reprojection** - Advanced camera movements via point clouds
- **Model-Native Control** - Fast camera control for simple movements

## Implementation Pattern
```python
class CinematographerAgent(Agent):
    role = "Expert Cinematographer"
    goal = "Create compelling visual storytelling through camera work"
    backstory = "Professional cinematographer with expertise in composition"
    
    tools = [
        generate_video_tool,
        apply_camera_control_tool,
        layerflow_compositing_tool,
        bokeh_enhancement_tool
    ]
```
