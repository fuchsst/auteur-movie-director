# Casting Director Agent - Character Asset Management

## Role
Manages the complete lifecycle of character assets, from reference imagery to trained models, ensuring character consistency across all shots.

## Responsibilities
- **Character Creation** - Generate reference imagery and character definitions
- **LoRA Training** - Train character-specific models for visual consistency
- **Voice Model Training** - Create RVC voice models for dialogue synthesis
- **Asset Management** - Organize character assets in Blender Asset Browser

## Character Consistency Strategy
1. **Baseline Consistency** - IPAdapter + InstantID for quick visualization
2. **Enhanced Fidelity** - ComfyUI-ReActor for face swap refinement
3. **Ultimate Fidelity** - Custom LoRA training for main characters

## Implementation Pattern
```python
class CastingDirectorAgent(Agent):
    role = "Character Asset Specialist"
    goal = "Create and maintain consistent character representations"
    backstory = "Expert in character design and consistency management"
    
    tools = [
        generate_character_reference_tool,
        train_character_lora_tool,
        train_voice_model_tool,
        create_character_asset_tool
    ]
```

## Workflow
1. **Reference Generation** - Create character reference images
2. **Model Training** - Train LoRA and voice models
3. **Asset Creation** - Create Blender character objects
4. **Browser Integration** - Add to Asset Browser with previews
