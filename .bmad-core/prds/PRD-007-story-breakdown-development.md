# Product Requirements Document: Story Breakdown and Development

## Executive Summary

The Story Breakdown and Development feature transforms abstract creative concepts into structured, executable film production plans through an AI-powered hierarchical workflow. This system bridges the gap between high-level artistic vision and granular technical requirements, enabling filmmakers to rapidly develop coherent narratives that can be directly translated into generative media production.

By integrating proven storytelling frameworks (Three-Act Structure, Seven-Point Story Structure, Blake Snyder Beat Sheet) with specialized AI agents, the feature provides a guided, iterative process that maintains creative intent while generating production-ready shot lists. This dramatically reduces the time from concept to production while ensuring narrative coherence and professional story structure.

### Target User Personas
- **Independent Filmmakers**: Need rapid story development with limited resources
- **Content Creators**: Require consistent narrative structure across episodic content
- **Creative Directors**: Want to explore multiple narrative variations quickly
- **AI Artists**: Seek structured prompts for coherent generative sequences

### Expected Impact
- **80% reduction** in story development time from concept to shot list
- **Elimination of narrative drift** in AI-generated content
- **Professional story structure** accessible to non-screenwriters
- **Seamless integration** from story to visual production

## Problem Statement

### Current Limitations in Generative Film Production

1. **The Translation Gap**: Converting abstract creative ideas into machine-executable instructions results in:
   - Loss of narrative coherence across generated content
   - Inconsistent character arcs and motivations
   - Lack of dramatic structure in AI-generated sequences

2. **Manual Workflow Inefficiencies**:
   - Hours spent manually breaking down scripts into shots
   - No standardized process for narrative-to-visual translation
   - Difficulty maintaining consistency across team collaborations

3. **AI Generation Challenges**:
   - LLMs produce unfocused narratives without structural guidance
   - Generated content lacks emotional pacing and dramatic tension
   - No connection between story intent and visual execution

### Pain Points in Existing Workflows

- **For Filmmakers**: Manual script breakdowns are time-consuming and error-prone
- **For AI Artists**: Lack of narrative context produces disconnected visuals
- **For Teams**: No shared framework for story structure and progression
- **For Productions**: Inconsistent quality due to unstructured generation

## Solution Overview

### Hierarchical Story Breakdown System

The solution implements a multi-tiered narrative framework that progressively refines creative concepts through specialized AI agent crews, with explicit integration of proven storytelling structures:

1. **Concept Development** (Writers' Room)
   - Interactive chat interface for initial brainstorming
   - AI-assisted logline generation and world-building
   - Story structure template selection (Three-Act, Five-Act, Hero's Journey, Save the Cat)
   - Human-in-the-loop approval at each stage

2. **Structural Mapping** (Three-Act Framework)
   - Automatic plot structure generation with act percentages:
     - Act I (Setup): 25% of story
     - Act II (Confrontation): 50% of story
     - Act III (Resolution): 25% of story
   - Chapter-based organization aligned with dramatic acts
   - Visual representation in Production Canvas with color coding
   - Act metadata files capturing purpose and emotional arc

3. **Scene Definition** (Seven-Point Structure)
   - Plot-driven scene breakdown mapped to seven key points:
     - Hook (starting point)
     - Plot Point 1 (call to adventure)
     - Pinch Point 1 (first pressure)
     - Midpoint (protagonist becomes proactive)
     - Pinch Point 2 (second pressure)
     - Plot Point 2 (final piece needed)
     - Resolution (climax and denouement)
   - Functional purpose for every narrative beat
   - Integration with asset management system
   - Chapter metadata tracking plot point functions

4. **Shot Generation** (Blake Snyder Beat Sheet Integration)
   - Detailed shot lists with emotional beats:
     - Opening Image
     - Theme Stated
     - Setup
     - Catalyst
     - Debate
     - Break into Two
     - B Story
     - Fun and Games
     - Midpoint
     - Bad Guys Close In
     - All Is Lost
     - Dark Night of the Soul
     - Break into Three
     - Finale
     - Final Image
   - Camera and lighting specs informed by emotional intensity
   - Character and location consistency through asset references
   - Direct integration with generative nodes

### Integration with BMAD Agent Framework

The feature leverages four specialized agent crews:

1. **Concept Crew**: Story Analyst, Logline Writer, World Builder
2. **Structuralist Crew**: Plot Architect, Chapter Decomposer
3. **Scene-wright Crew**: Plot Point Specialist, Beat Sheet Writer
4. **Cinematographer Crew**: Script Parser, Character Prompter, Shot Designer

Each crew operates within the CrewAI framework, ensuring structured collaboration and predictable outputs.
