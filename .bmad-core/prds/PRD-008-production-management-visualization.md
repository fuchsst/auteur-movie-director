# Product Requirements Document: Digital Production Management & Scene Visualization Suite

## Executive Summary

The Digital Production Management & Scene Visualization Suite enhances Auteur's creative workflow by providing comprehensive scene visualization, digital asset management, and production analytics. This system bridges creative planning with technical execution through timeline-based scene visualization, expanded digital asset ecosystems, and collaborative production interfaces.

By integrating traditional story structure visualization with AI-driven content organization, the suite enables creators to maintain narrative coherence while efficiently managing complex generative projects. It transforms abstract story structures into actionable production plans without physical logistics.

### Target User Personas
- **Creative Directors**: Need scene visualization and story structure oversight
- **Content Creators**: Require narrative coherence across episodic content
- **AI Artists**: Seek structured asset management for generative sequences
- **Narrative Designers**: Want visual story structure and beat tracking
- **Project Managers**: Need digital asset analytics and workflow optimization

### Expected Impact
- **80% reduction** in story-to-production planning time
- **95% improvement** in narrative consistency across generated content
- **Professional-grade** scene visualization and story structure mapping
- **Seamless integration** between creative vision and technical execution
- **Enhanced collaboration** for distributed creative teams

## Problem Statement

This PRD establishes EPIC-008 as the digital story management and visualization layer that transforms Auteur into a comprehensive creative platform for narrative-driven generative content creation, focusing entirely on digital workflows without physical production logistics."} and then called exit_plan_mode:2 with the following plan: I've created PRD-008: Digital Production Management & Scene Visualization Suite that focuses exclusively on digital workflows without physical logistics. This addresses the comprehensive scene visualization and story management needs identified in the concept documents while maintaining clear boundaries with existing EPICs.

Key changes made:
- Removed all physical logistics (props, wardrobe, vehicles, scheduling)
- Focused on digital asset ecosystems and story visualization
- Emphasized narrative structure, character arcs, and story beats
- Created clear digital-only asset types (digital props, environments, styles)
- Maintained collaboration features for creative teams
- Established clear integration boundaries with existing PRDs

The PRD provides:
- Multi-view story interfaces (timeline, grid, character arcs)
- Enhanced digital asset management
- Narrative analytics and quality assurance
- Collaborative story development tools
- Professional story structure visualization

Ready to proceed with implementation planning for EPIC-008. The next step would be to break this into specific user stories and technical implementation tasks. Would you like me to proceed with creating the EPIC and breaking it down into implementable stories?{
