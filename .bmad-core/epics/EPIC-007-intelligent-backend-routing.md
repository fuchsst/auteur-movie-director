# Epic: Intelligent Backend Routing

**Epic ID:** EPIC-007  
**Based on PRD:** PRD-001 (Backend Integration Service Layer)  
**Target Milestone:** v0.3.0 - Agent Intelligence Release  
**Priority:** Medium (P2)  
**Owner:** Backend Integration Team  
**Status:** Ready for Development  

---

## Epic Description

The Intelligent Backend Routing epic implements smart decision-making for selecting the optimal backend service for each generation task. Rather than hardcoding which backend handles what, this system analyzes task requirements (quality needs, speed requirements, model availability, resource constraints) and automatically routes to the most appropriate backend. This includes choosing between ComfyUI and Wan2GP for video, selecting quality/speed tradeoffs, and handling failover scenarios.

This epic transforms the backend layer from a simple pass-through to an intelligent orchestrator that optimizes for quality, speed, and resource utilization based on user intent and system capabilities.

## Business Value

- **Performance Optimization**: Tasks complete faster by using the right backend
- **Quality Optimization**: High-quality outputs when needed, fast drafts when appropriate  
- **Resource Efficiency**: Better utilization of available compute resources
- **Reliability**: Automatic failover when backends are unavailable
- **User Simplicity**: Users don't need to understand backend differences

## User Stories

### Story 1: Task Requirement Analysis
**As the** routing system  
**I want** to understand task requirements  
**So that** I can make optimal routing decisions  

**Given** a generation request  
**When** analyzing requirements  
**Then** I identify quality needs (draft/final)  
**And** determine complexity score  
**And** check for special requirements  
**And** estimate resource needs  
**And** consider user preferences  

**Story Points:** 8  
**Dependencies:** None  

### Story 2: Backend Capability Registry
**As the** routing system  
**I want** to know backend capabilities  
**So that** I can match tasks to backends  

**Given** available backends  
**When** building capability registry  
**Then** I catalog supported models  
**And** track performance characteristics  
**And** note special features  
**And** monitor availability  
**And** update dynamically  

**Story Points:** 8  
**Dependencies:** EPIC-001  

### Story 3: Quality vs Speed Routing
**As a** user generating content  
**I want** appropriate quality/speed tradeoffs  
**So that** I get results when I need them  

**Given** a generation request  
**When** the user wants "draft" quality  
**Then** route to fastest backend  
**And** use optimized models  
**And** reduce parameters  
**But** when user wants "final" quality  
**Then** route to highest quality backend  

**Story Points:** 5  
**Dependencies:** Story 1, Story 2  

### Story 4: Intelligent Failover
**As a** user  
**I want** automatic failover  
**So that** generation continues despite failures  

**Given** a backend fails during routing  
**When** failure is detected  
**Then** system identifies alternatives  
**And** routes to next best option  
**And** adjusts parameters if needed  
**And** notifies user of change  
**And** continues generation  

**Story Points:** 8  
**Dependencies:** Story 2, EPIC-001  

### Story 5: Routing Explanation
**As a** power user  
**I want** to understand routing decisions  
**So that** I can optimize my workflow  

**Given** a completed generation  
**When** I view task details  
**Then** I see which backend was used  
**And** why it was selected  
**And** what alternatives existed  
**And** performance metrics  
**And** suggestions for optimization  

**Story Points:** 5  
**Dependencies:** Story 1, Story 3  

### Story 6: A/B Testing Framework
**As a** system administrator  
**I want** to test routing strategies  
**So that** I can improve performance  

**Given** multiple routing strategies  
**When** A/B testing is enabled  
**Then** traffic splits between strategies  
**And** performance is measured  
**And** results are compared  
**And** best strategy identified  
**And** gradual rollout supported  

**Story Points:** 8  
**Dependencies:** Story 1-4
