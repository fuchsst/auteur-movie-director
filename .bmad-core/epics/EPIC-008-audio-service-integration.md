## Epic Description

The Audio Service Integration epic implements comprehensive audio generation capabilities by integrating RVC for voice cloning/synthesis, AudioLDM for sound effects and ambient audio, and music generation services. This epic transforms the Blender Movie Director from a video-only tool into a complete audiovisual content creation system, with synchronized dialogue, sound effects, and music that matches the visual content.

Audio is critical for professional film production - this epic ensures that generated videos have matching high-quality audio, including character-specific voices, appropriate sound effects, and mood-matching music, all synchronized with the visual content.

## Business Value

## User Stories

### Story 1: Character Voice Training
**As a** filmmaker with character dialogue  
**I want** to train unique voices for characters  
**So that** each character sounds distinct  

**Given** voice samples for a character  
**When** I train a voice model  
**Then** RVC creates a voice model file  
**And** training uses provided samples  
**And** model quality is validated  
**And** model is saved with character  
**And** can be reused across scenes  

**Story Points:** 13  
**Dependencies:** EPIC-002 (RVC client)  

### Story 2: Dialogue Generation
**As a** user with scripted dialogue  
**I want** to generate character voices  
**So that** my videos have speech  

**Given** dialogue text and character voice  
**When** generating audio  
**Then** RVC synthesizes the speech  
**And** uses character's voice model  
**And** maintains consistent tone  
**And** handles long passages  
**And** outputs clean audio files  

**Story Points:** 8  
**Dependencies:** Story 1, PRD-003  

### Story 3: Sound Effect Generation
**As a** creator needing sound effects  
**I want** AI-generated effects  
**So that** scenes have appropriate audio  

**Given** scene action descriptions  
**When** I generate sound effects  
**Then** AudioLDM creates matching sounds  
**And** effects match the action timing  
**And** quality is professional  
**And** multiple effects can layer  
**And** volume is appropriate  

**Story Points:** 8  
**Dependencies:** EPIC-002 (AudioLDM client)  

### Story 4: Music Generation
**As a** filmmaker setting mood  
**I want** AI-generated music  
**So that** scenes have emotional impact  

**Given** scene mood and style  
**When** generating background music  
**Then** music matches the mood  
**And** style fits the scene  
**And** duration matches video  
**And** loops seamlessly if needed  
**And** volume balances with dialogue  

**Story Points:** 8  
**Dependencies:** EPIC-002  

### Story 5: Audio-Video Synchronization
**As a** user creating complete content  
**I want** audio and video synchronized  
**So that** the result is professional  

**Given** video with multiple audio tracks  
**When** assembling final output  
**Then** dialogue syncs with video  
**And** effects align with actions  
**And** music starts/stops correctly  
**And** all tracks are balanced  
**And** export includes all audio  

**Story Points:** 13  
**Dependencies:** Story 2-4, EPIC-005  

### Story 6: Voice Consistency Management
**As a** project manager  
**I want** voice consistency tracking  
**So that** characters sound the same throughout  

**Given** multiple scenes with dialogue  
**When** reviewing character voices  
**Then** I can verify consistency  
**And** detect voice drift  
**And** retrain if needed  
**And** maintain voice library  
**And** share models across projects  

**Story Points:** 5  
**Dependencies:** Story 1-2
