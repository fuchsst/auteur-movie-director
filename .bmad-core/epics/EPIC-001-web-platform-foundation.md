## Epic Description
Establish the foundational web-based platform architecture for the Auteur Movie Director, enabling the systematic translation of creative vision into AI-executable instructions. This epic focuses on building a simple, working local development system with SvelteKit frontend and FastAPI backend, implementing file-based project management that supports the hierarchical filmmaking structure (Project → Chapter → Scene → Shot → Take), and preparing the infrastructure for the Function Runner pattern that will execute the generative pipeline.

## Business Value
- **Creative Translation**: Systematic framework for converting narrative concepts into machine-executable instructions
- **Professional Workflow**: Git-based project management with Takes system enables non-destructive iteration
- **Character Identity Management**: Living character assets with consistent visual identity through LoRA models
- **Modular Control**: Separation of concerns for character identity, aesthetic language, narrative action, and emotional tone
- **Collaborative Foundation**: Prepares for multi-agent creative workflows (Producer, Screenwriter, Art Director, etc.)
- **Extensible Architecture**: Function Runner pattern allows integration of diverse AI models for each creative task

## Dependencies
- **Development Environment**: 
  - Node.js 20+ (for IDE support and local tooling)
  - Python 3.12+ (for local development tools)
  - Docker Engine 20.10+ and Docker Compose
  - Git and Git LFS (mandatory prerequisite)
  - Make utility (for developer interface)
- **Workspace Structure**: Decision on default workspace location (/Generative_Studio_Workspace/)
- **Project Structure**: Finalized numbered directory layout from PRD-004
- **API Design**: Basic REST endpoints defined
- **Container Architecture**: Docker images for all services

## Risk Factors
- **Cross-Platform Paths**: File path handling between Windows/Mac/Linux
- **Git Integration**: Handling Git operations from web context
- **Git LFS**: Ensuring all developers have LFS installed and configured
- **WebSocket Stability**: Connection drops and reconnection logic
- **File Permissions**: Web app accessing local filesystem
- **Container Resources**: Local machine VRAM/RAM constraints

**Team Size**: 2 developers (1 frontend, 1 backend)

## Key Implementation Gaps

### Critical Issues
1. **API Client (STORY-011)**: Fundamentally broken - all endpoint methods call non-existent functions
2. **WebSocket Service (STORY-005)**: Only basic infrastructure, missing event broadcasting system
3. **Function Runner (STORY-013)**: No Celery workers or Docker SDK integration

### Missing Features
1. **Settings Persistence**: UI exists but no backend storage
2. **Advanced UI Features**: Undo/redo, toast notifications, drag-and-drop reordering
3. **Canvas Integration**: Node components built but no actual canvas implementation
4. **Metadata & Optimization**: File metadata extraction, thumbnail generation, storage optimization

### Integration Gaps
1. **Git LFS**: Service exists but not integrated with takes/uploads
2. **WebSocket Events**: Limited event types implemented vs specification
3. **Property Updates**: Only project properties work, asset properties TODO

## Success Metrics
- Projects created with narrative structure and correct directory layout
- Creative assets (Characters, Locations, Styles) properly categorized
- Character assets display full Character Sheet UI with all panels
- Character data model supports LoRA paths and variation storage
- Asset usage tracking accurately shows character dependencies
- Takes system generates versioned outputs without overwrites
- WebSocket maintains stable connection for real-time updates
- File uploads route to appropriate asset categories
- Git repositories initialize with LFS for media files
- API responds quickly (< 200ms local)
- UI reflects hierarchical project structure (Chapter → Scene → Shot → Take)

### API Design Principles
- Simple REST endpoints for CRUD operations
- File operations use multipart/form-data
- WebSocket for real-time notifications
- Consistent JSON error responses
- Clear HTTP status codes

GET    /api/projects/{id}       # Get project details
DELETE /api/projects/{id}       # Delete project
POST   /api/projects/{id}/files # Upload files
GET    /api/projects/{id}/files # List project files
WS     /ws/{project_id}        # Project-specific WebSocket connection

# Function Runner Foundation Endpoints
POST   /api/tasks/submit       # Submit generation task
GET    /api/tasks/{id}/status  # Get task status
GET    /api/quality/mappings   # Get quality to pipeline mappings

### Function Runner Foundation
The platform architecture is designed to support the Function Runner pattern for AI model execution, enabling the systematic translation of creative intent into machine-executable instructions:

#### Task Dispatcher Architecture
```python
# Dispatcher service maps quality settings to pipeline configurations
QUALITY_PIPELINE_MAPPING = {
    "low": {
        "pipeline_id": "auteur-flux:1.0-draft",
        "target_vram": 12,
        "optimizations": ["cpu_offloading", "sequential"],
        "use_case": "rapid iteration and previz"
    },
    "standard": {
        "pipeline_id": "auteur-flux:1.0-standard",
        "target_vram": 16,
        "optimizations": ["moderate_parallel"],
        "use_case": "production quality"
    },
    "high": {
        "pipeline_id": "auteur-flux:1.0-cinematic",
        "target_vram": 24,
        "optimizations": ["full_parallel"],
        "use_case": "final renders"
    }
}
```

#### Composite Prompt Assembly
The system supports multi-modal instruction sets composed of:
- **Direct Instructions**: Text prompts with shot descriptions
- **Identity Instructions**: Character asset references (future LoRA integration)
- **Aesthetic Instructions**: Style asset references with visual keywords
- **Context Instructions**: Scene and emotional beat metadata

#### Celery Task Structure
```python
# Foundation for Function Runner tasks
@celery_app.task
def execute_generation(node_id: str, project_id: str, parameters: dict):
    # 1. Retrieve node data and project quality setting
    # 2. Map quality to pipeline configuration
    # 3. Prepare task payload with output paths
    # 4. Publish progress updates via Redis pub/sub
    # 5. Return success/failure with output path
    pass
```

#### WebSocket Progress Relay
- Worker publishes events to Redis pub/sub channel
- FastAPI WebSocket manager subscribes to channels
- Events forwarded to appropriate client connections
- Enables real-time progress tracking for long-running tasks
