# Epic: CrewAI Agent Tool Integration

**Epic ID:** EPIC-006  
**Based on PRD:** PRD-001 (Backend Integration Service Layer)  
**Target Milestone:** v0.3.0 - Agent Intelligence Release  
**Priority:** High (P1)  
**Owner:** AI Integration Team  
**Status:** Ready for Development  

---

## Epic Description

The CrewAI Agent Tool Integration epic implements the bridge between the BMAD film crew agents (Producer, Screenwriter, Casting Director, etc.) and the backend execution capabilities. This epic transforms conceptual AI agents into functional entities by providing them with concrete tools that execute via the backend integration layer. Each tool wraps backend functionality in an agent-friendly interface that follows CrewAI patterns.

This is where the film crew metaphor becomes reality - agents gain the ability to actually generate content, analyze scripts, create characters, and coordinate complex multi-step workflows. The integration must maintain the intuitive film crew abstractions while leveraging all backend capabilities.

## Business Value

- **Intelligent Automation**: Agents can make decisions and execute complex workflows
- **User Abstraction**: Technical complexity hidden behind familiar film roles
- **Workflow Orchestration**: Agents coordinate to achieve user goals

## User Stories

### Story 1: Screenwriter Script Analysis Tool
**As the** Screenwriter agent  
**I want** to analyze scripts and extract structure  
**So that** I can create scene and shot breakdowns  

**Given** a screenplay text  
**When** I use the analyze_script tool  
**Then** I can extract scenes, characters, and dialogue  
**And** identify shot opportunities  
**And** return structured JSON data  
**And** handle various script formats  

**Story Points:** 8  
**Dependencies:** EPIC-002 (LiteLLM client)  

### Story 2: Casting Director Character Creation Tools
**As the** Casting Director agent  
**I want** tools to create consistent characters  
**So that** I can manage character assets  

**Given** character descriptions and references  
**When** I use character generation tools  
**Then** I can generate character variations  
**And** train character LoRAs  
**And** manage character consistency  
**And** track character usage  

**Story Points:** 13  
**Dependencies:** EPIC-004 (Workflow execution)  

### Story 3: Cinematographer Shot Generation Tools
**As the** Cinematographer agent  
**I want** video generation tools  
**So that** I can create shots from descriptions  

**Given** shot descriptions and assets  
**When** I use video generation tools  
**Then** I can generate video clips  
**And** apply camera movements  
**And** use character/style assets  
**And** maintain visual consistency  

**Story Points:** 13  
**Dependencies:** EPIC-004, EPIC-007  

### Story 4: Producer Orchestration Tools
**As the** Producer agent  
**I want** workflow coordination tools  
**So that** I can manage the entire production  

**Given** a production goal  
**When** I coordinate other agents  
**Then** I can assign tasks to agents  
**And** track task progress  
**And** handle dependencies  
**And** optimize resource usage  

**Story Points:** 8  
**Dependencies:** Story 1-3  

### Story 5: Inter-Agent Communication
**As any** film crew agent  
**I want** to communicate with other agents  
**So that** we can collaborate on complex tasks  

**Given** a task requiring multiple agents  
**When** I need another agent's expertise  
**Then** I can send requests to specific agents  
**And** receive and parse responses  
**And** maintain conversation context  
**And** handle async communication  

**Story Points:** 8  
**Dependencies:** CrewAI framework  

### Story 6: Agent Memory and State
**As an** agent working on a project  
**I want** to remember previous decisions  
**So that** I maintain consistency  

**Given** ongoing project work  
**When** I make decisions  
**Then** my state is preserved  
**And** I can recall past actions  
**And** I learn from outcomes  
**And** state survives restarts  

**Story Points:** 5  
**Dependencies:** Story 1-4  

## Technical Requirements

   ```python
   @tool("Generate Character Variations")
   def generate_character_variations(
       character_name: str,
       reference_images: List[str],
       variation_count: int = 4,
       consistency_level: str = "high"
   ) -> Dict[str, Any]:
       """Generate variations of a character with consistency"""
       
       # Select appropriate workflow
       workflow = select_character_workflow(consistency_level)
       
       # Inject parameters
       params = {
           "character_name": character_name,
           "references": reference_images,
           "count": variation_count
       }
       
       # Execute via backend
       result = workflow_executor.execute(workflow, params)
       
       # Format for agent consumption
       return {
           "status": "success",
           "generated_images": result.output_paths,
