## Success Metrics

Each epic includes specific success metrics. Key overall metrics for PRD-001:

- **Reliability**: >99% uptime for backend connections
- **Performance**: <100ms overhead per operation
- **Quality**: >95% task success rate
- **Usability**: >90% user satisfaction
- **Scalability**: Linear performance scaling

## Epic Template

All epics follow the BMAD Product Owner template structure:
- Epic Description and Business Value
- Scope & Boundaries
- Acceptance Criteria (Functional, Technical, Quality)
- User Stories with Story Points
- Technical Requirements and Architecture
- Integration Points with other epics/PRDs
- Risk Assessment and Mitigation
- Success Metrics
- Dependencies and Timeline

## Next Steps

1. Review and approve epics with stakeholders
2. Break down epics into sprint-ready user stories
3. Assign development teams to each epic
4. Create technical design documents
5. Set up epic tracking in project management tool
