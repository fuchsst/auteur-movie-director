```

## Technical Architecture Decisions

### File System Design
- **Project Root**: Workspace-relative paths
- **Atomic Operations**: Use temp files and rename
- **Validation**: Check structure before operations
- **Error Recovery**: Rollback on failure

### Git Strategy
- **Shallow Clones**: For performance
- **Auto-commit**: Batch changes for efficiency
- **LFS Patterns**: Comprehensive media coverage
- **Ignore Patterns**: Exclude temp/cache files

### Concurrency Handling
- **File Locks**: OS-level for writes
- **Queue System**: Redis for long operations
- **Optimistic UI**: Update immediately, rollback on error

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
1. **Git Performance**
   - Monitor repository size
   - Implement shallow clones

## Notes

This epic focuses exclusively on the file management and version control aspects of the platform. Integration with the Production Canvas (PRD-004) and AI execution (PRD-003) will be handled in their respective epics.

The takes system is a critical differentiator that enables non-destructive experimentation. Priority should be given to making this system intuitive and reliable.

Story structure directories are included as part of the project scaffolding, but automated story generation is explicitly excluded from this epic (handled in PRD-007).
