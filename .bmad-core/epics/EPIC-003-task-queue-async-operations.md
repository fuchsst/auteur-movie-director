# Epic: Task Queue and Async Operations

**Epic ID:** EPIC-003  
**Based on PRD:** PRD-001 (Backend Integration Service Layer)  
**Target Milestone:** v0.1.0 - Foundation Release  
**Priority:** Critical (P0)  
**Owner:** Backend Integration Team  
**Status:** Ready for Development  

---

## Epic Description

The Task Queue and Async Operations epic implements the asynchronous execution framework that prevents the Blender UI from freezing during long-running AI generation tasks. This system manages a queue of generation jobs, executes them on background threads, provides real-time progress updates, and handles results/errors gracefully while maintaining Blender's single-threaded UI constraints.

This epic is essential for user experience - without proper async handling, the addon would freeze Blender for minutes during generation, making it unusable. The system must coordinate multiple concurrent operations while respecting resource limits and maintaining UI responsiveness.

## Business Value

- **User Experience**: Blender remains fully responsive during AI generation
- **Productivity**: Multiple operations can queue and execute efficiently
- **Reliability**: Crash recovery and job persistence across sessions
- **Scalability**: Foundation for parallel execution and batch operations
- **Professional Quality**: Expected behavior for production tools

## User Stories

### Story 1: Non-Blocking Generation
**As a** filmmaker working in Blender  
**I want** to continue working while content generates  
**So that** I don't waste time waiting for AI  

**Given** I trigger a video generation  
**When** the generation starts  
**Then** Blender UI remains fully responsive  
**And** I can navigate scenes and edit properties  
**And** I see a progress indicator updating  
**And** I'm notified when generation completes  

**Story Points:** 13  
**Dependencies:** EPIC-002 (API Client Infrastructure)  

### Story 2: Queue Management UI
**As a** content creator with multiple shots  
**I want** to see and manage my generation queue  
**So that** I can track progress and prioritize work  

**Given** multiple generation jobs are queued  
**When** I open the queue panel  
**Then** I see all pending, active, and completed jobs  
**And** each job shows progress percentage  
**And** I can cancel pending jobs  
**And** I can clear completed jobs  
**And** I can reorder pending jobs  

**Story Points:** 8  
**Dependencies:** Story 1  

### Story 3: Progress Tracking
**As a** user generating content  
**I want** accurate progress information  
**So that** I can estimate completion time  

**Given** an active generation job  
**When** I view the progress  
**Then** I see percentage complete  
**And** estimated time remaining  
**And** current processing stage  
**And** the information updates smoothly  
**And** progress is accurate to within 5%  

**Story Points:** 5  
**Dependencies:** Story 1  

### Story 4: Job Persistence
**As a** user with long-running jobs  
**I want** jobs to survive Blender crashes  
**So that** I don't lose progress on system failures  

**Given** jobs are in the queue  
**When** Blender unexpectedly closes  
**Then** queue state is preserved  
**And** on restart, pending jobs resume  
**And** partial results are recovered  
**And** I'm notified of the recovery  

**Story Points:** 8  
**Dependencies:** Story 1  

### Story 5: Parallel Execution Control
**As a** power user with good hardware  
**I want** to control parallel execution  
**So that** I can optimize for my system  

**Given** the addon preferences  
**When** I adjust parallel execution settings  
**Then** I can set max concurrent jobs (1-8)  
**And** I can set memory limits  
**And** the system respects these limits  
**And** jobs queue when limits are reached  

**Story Points:** 5  
**Dependencies:** Story 1, Story 2  

### Story 6: Error Recovery
**As a** user experiencing generation failures  
**I want** clear error information and recovery options  
**So that** I can resolve issues and continue working  

**Given** a job fails during execution  
**When** I view the failed job  
**Then** I see the specific error message  
**And** I can view detailed error logs  
**And** I can retry with same parameters  
**And** I can modify and retry  
**And** other jobs continue unaffected  

**Story Points:** 5  
**Dependencies:** Story 1, Story 2  

## Technical Requirements

### Architecture Components

1. **Task Queue Manager**
   ```python
   class TaskQueueManager:
       def __init__(self, max_workers=4):
           self.queue = PriorityQueue()
           self.executor = ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers)
           self.active_tasks = {}
           self.completed_tasks = deque(maxlen=100)
           
       async def submit(self, task: Task, priority=5):
           future = self.executor.submit(task.execute)
           self.active_tasks[task.id] = (task, future)
           
       def cancel(self, task_id: str):
           if task_id in self.active_tasks:
               task, future = self.active_tasks[task_id]
               future.cancel()
   ```

   - Batch UI updates
   - Thread-safe communication

5. **Resource Management**
