# Epic: Workflow Execution Engine

**Epic ID:** EPIC-004  
**Based on PRD:** PRD-001 (Backend Integration Service Layer)  
**Target Milestone:** v0.2.0 - Core Generation Release  
**Priority:** Critical (P0)  
**Owner:** Backend Integration Team  
**Status:** Ready for Development  

---

## Epic Description

The Workflow Execution Engine epic implements the core system that transforms high-level generation requests into executable backend workflows. This engine loads workflow templates (ComfyUI JSON, Wan2GP configs), injects parameters from Blender's UI and data model, manages multi-step execution, and handles results. It serves as the bridge between user intent and the complex node graphs required by AI backends.

This is where the "magic" happens - turning a simple "Generate Character" button click into a sophisticated multi-model workflow involving IPAdapter, ControlNet, face swapping, and LoRA loading. The engine must handle the complexity while presenting a simple interface to the rest of the system.

## Business Value

- **Complexity Abstraction**: Users get powerful workflows without technical knowledge
- **Flexibility**: New workflows added without code changes
- **Consistency**: Standardized parameter injection ensures reliable results
- **Efficiency**: Workflow optimization and caching improve performance
- **Innovation**: Easy experimentation with new AI techniques via templates

## User Stories

### Story 1: Template-Based Character Generation
**As a** filmmaker creating characters  
**I want** complex character workflows to just work  
**So that** I can focus on creative decisions  

**Given** I have character reference images  
**When** I click "Generate Character Variations"  
**Then** the system loads the character workflow template  
**And** injects my image paths and descriptions  
**And** executes IPAdapter + ControlNet workflow  
**And** returns generated character images  
**And** I never see the workflow complexity  

**Story Points:** 13  
**Dependencies:** EPIC-002, EPIC-003  

### Story 2: Parameter Injection System
**As a** developer creating workflows  
**I want** automatic parameter injection  
**So that** workflows adapt to user inputs  

**Given** a workflow template with placeholders  
**When** the workflow is executed  
**Then** {prompt} is replaced with user text  
**And** {character_lora} points to the right file  
**And** {seed} uses the saved random seed  
**And** all paths are absolute and valid  
**And** missing parameters use defaults  

**Story Points:** 8  
**Dependencies:** EPIC-002  

### Story 3: Multi-Step Workflow Coordination
**As a** user generating complex content  
**I want** multi-step workflows to execute smoothly  
**So that** I get integrated results  

**Given** a workflow with multiple stages  
**When** execution begins  
**Then** each step executes in sequence  
**And** outputs from step N feed step N+1  
**And** progress shows overall completion  
**And** failures indicate which step failed  
**And** partial results are accessible  

**Story Points:** 13  
**Dependencies:** EPIC-003  

### Story 4: Workflow Template Management
**As a** technical artist  
**I want** to manage workflow templates  
**So that** I can customize generation pipelines  

**Given** the workflow template directory  
**When** I add or modify templates  
**Then** new templates appear in the UI  
**And** modified templates reload automatically  
**And** invalid templates show validation errors  
**And** I can export successful workflows  
**And** version conflicts are detected  

**Story Points:** 8  
**Dependencies:** Story 1  

### Story 5: Result Extraction and Mapping
**As a** developer integrating results  
**I want** standardized result extraction  
**So that** I can reliably process outputs  

**Given** a completed workflow  
**When** I retrieve results  
**Then** all output files are listed  
**And** file types are correctly identified  
**And** metadata is extracted  
**And** paths are resolved correctly  
**And** results map to Blender assets  

**Story Points:** 5  
**Dependencies:** Story 1, Story 3  

### Story 6: Workflow Optimization
**As a** user with limited resources  
**I want** workflows optimized for efficiency  
**So that** generation is as fast as possible  

**Given** a standard workflow  
**When** optimization is enabled  
**Then** redundant nodes are removed  
**And** model loading is minimized  
**And** unnecessary steps are skipped  
**And** caching is utilized  
**And** performance improves >20%  

**Story Points:** 8  
**Dependencies:** Story 1, Story 2

       def load_template(self, name: str) -> WorkflowTemplate:
           # Load, validate, cache, and return template
           
       def inject_parameters(self, template: WorkflowTemplate, 
                           params: Dict) -> Dict:
