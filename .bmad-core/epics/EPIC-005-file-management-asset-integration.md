# Epic: File Management and Asset Integration

**Epic ID:** EPIC-005  
**Based on PRD:** PRD-001 (Backend Integration Service Layer)  
**Target Milestone:** v0.2.0 - Core Generation Release  
**Priority:** High (P1)  
**Owner:** Backend Integration Team  
**Status:** Ready for Development  

---

## Epic Description

The File Management and Asset Integration epic implements the critical system that manages all generated content files and integrates them seamlessly into Blender's asset system. This includes organizing generated images/videos/audio into a hierarchical directory structure, importing them as Blender assets, updating the Asset Browser, and supporting the regenerative content model where only file references are stored in the .blend file.

This epic bridges the gap between raw AI-generated files and usable Blender assets, ensuring that generated content is properly organized, easily accessible, and maintains relationships with the generation parameters that created it.

## Business Value

- **Organization**: Automatic file organization prevents chaos in large projects
- **Discoverability**: Generated assets immediately available in Asset Browser
- **Efficiency**: No manual import/organization of generated content
- **Portability**: Projects remain portable with relative path management
- **Scalability**: Handles thousands of assets without performance degradation

## User Stories

### Story 1: Automatic Asset Organization
**As a** filmmaker generating lots of content  
**I want** files automatically organized  
**So that** I can find everything easily  

**Given** I generate character variations  
**When** generation completes  
**Then** files are saved in project_name/characters/character_name/  
**And** each file has a descriptive name  
**And** versions are numbered sequentially  
**And** metadata is preserved  
**And** no files are overwritten  

**Story Points:** 8  
**Dependencies:** EPIC-004  

### Story 2: Asset Browser Integration
**As a** Blender user  
**I want** generated content in the Asset Browser  
**So that** I can use it immediately in my scene  

**Given** new content is generated  
**When** file management completes  
**Then** assets appear in Asset Browser  
**And** they have appropriate previews  
**And** they're tagged by type  
**And** I can drag them into scenes  
**And** metadata is accessible  

**Story Points:** 13  
**Dependencies:** Story 1  

### Story 3: Regenerative File References
**As a** user of the regenerative model  
**I want** only file paths stored in .blend  
**So that** my project files stay small  

**Given** I save my project  
**When** the .blend file is written  
**Then** only relative paths are stored  
**And** no media is embedded  
**And** file size remains small  
**And** paths resolve on project open  
**And** missing files are detected  

**Story Points:** 8  
**Dependencies:** Story 1, PRD-007  

### Story 4: Temporary File Management
**As a** user with limited disk space  
**I want** temporary files cleaned up  
**So that** my disk doesn't fill up  

**Given** generation creates temp files  
**When** final results are ready  
**Then** temp files are deleted  
**And** only final outputs remain  
**And** cleanup happens automatically  
**And** failed generations are cleaned  
**And** I can configure retention  

**Story Points:** 5  
**Dependencies:** Story 1  

### Story 5: Cross-Platform Portability
**As a** team working across OS platforms  
**I want** projects to work everywhere  
**So that** we can collaborate smoothly  

**Given** a project created on Windows  
**When** opened on Mac/Linux  
**Then** all paths resolve correctly  
**And** no absolute paths break  
**And** path separators are handled  
**And** file names are compatible  
**And** no data is lost  

**Story Points:** 8  
**Dependencies:** Story 3  

### Story 6: Asset Usage Tracking
**As a** project manager  
**I want** to track asset usage  
**So that** I know what's actually needed  

**Given** assets in my project  
**When** I view asset properties  
**Then** I see where it's used  
**And** I see generation history  
**And** I can find unused assets  
**And** I can clean up safely  
**And** dependencies are clear  

**Story Points:** 5  
**Dependencies:** Story 2

       def organize_generated_file(self, 
                                 source_path: Path,
                                 asset_type: str,
                                 context: Dict) -> Path:
           # Create directory structure
