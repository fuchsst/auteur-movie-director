# Create Addon Feature Task

## Purpose

To identify the next logical addon feature based on project progress and development roadmap, and then to prepare a comprehensive, self-contained, and actionable feature specification using the `Addon Feature Template`. This task ensures the feature is enriched with all necessary technical context, requirements, and acceptance criteria, making it ready for efficient implementation by a Developer Agent with minimal need for additional research.

## Task Execution Instructions

### 0. Load Core Configuration

[[LLM: CRITICAL - This MUST be your first step]]

- Load `.bmad-core/core-config.yml` from the project root
- If the file does not exist:
  - HALT and inform the user: "core-config.yml not found. This file is required for feature creation. You can:
    1. Copy it from GITHUB BMAD-METHOD/bmad-core/core-config.yml and configure it for your project
    2. Run the BMAD installer against your project to upgrade and add the file automatically
    Please add and configure core-config.yml before proceeding."
- Extract the following key configurations:
  - `dev-story-location`: Where to save feature files (adapted from dev-story-location)
  - `prd-file`: Main addon requirements document path
  - `architecture-file`: Addon architecture document path
  - `devLoadAlwaysFiles`: Files that should be pre-loaded for context

### 1. Assess Current Project State

[[LLM: Read and analyze the following to understand current addon development state]]

**Read the main documents:**
- Load the addon requirements document (from `prd-file` config)
- Load the addon architecture document (from `architecture-file` config)
- Load any existing feature specifications from the feature location

**Analyze current development progress:**
- Review existing addon features and their implementation status
- Identify gaps in the current addon functionality
- Check the project roadmap and development priorities
- Assess which film production workflows need implementation next

### 2. Identify Next Priority Feature

**Feature Prioritization Criteria:**
- **Foundation First**: Core addon structure, UI panels, basic workflows
- **User Impact**: Features that enable key film production workflows
- **Technical Dependencies**: Features that unlock other functionality
- **Resource Availability**: Features matching current development resources
- **VRAM Constraints**: Features optimized for target hardware limitations

**Common Feature Categories:**
- **Core Infrastructure**: Addon registration, UI framework, data models
- **Script Development**: Text editor integration, AI-assisted writing, scene breakdown
- **Asset Management**: Character system, style management, location assets
- **Video Generation**: Cinematographer agent, ComfyUI integration, shot generation
- **Audio Generation**: Sound designer agent, voice cloning, audio sync
- **Post-Production**: VSE integration, assembly automation, export pipeline

### 3. Create Feature Specification

Using the addon feature template, create a comprehensive specification including:

**Feature Overview:**
- Clear feature name and description
- User value proposition and creative workflow integration
- Relationship to film production pipeline

**Technical Requirements:**
- Blender API integration requirements
- CrewAI agent implementation needs
- Backend integration (ComfyUI, Wan2GP, LiteLLM)
- VRAM and performance considerations

**Implementation Details:**
- UI panel design and operator definitions
- Data model and custom property requirements
- Agent coordination and workflow orchestration
- Error handling and fallback strategies

**Quality Criteria:**
- Blender best practices compliance
- Performance benchmarks and resource limits
- User experience standards and accessibility
- Cross-version compatibility requirements

### 4. Validate Feature Readiness

**Technical Validation:**
- [ ] Feature aligns with current addon architecture
- [ ] Dependencies are available or implementable
- [ ] Resource requirements are reasonable
- [ ] Integration points are well-defined

**User Experience Validation:**
- [ ] Feature supports film production workflows
- [ ] UI follows Blender's calm, consistent design principles
- [ ] Workflow integration is intuitive and non-disruptive
- [ ] Error scenarios are handled gracefully

**Development Readiness:**
- [ ] Acceptance criteria are measurable and testable
- [ ] Implementation tasks are clearly defined
- [ ] Required expertise and tools are available
- [ ] Timeline and milestones are realistic
