# Blender Addon Architecture Validation Checklist

This checklist serves as a comprehensive framework for the Architect to validate the Blender addon architecture before development execution. The Architect should systematically work through each item, ensuring the addon architecture is robust, performant, Blender-native, and aligned with film production requirements.

4. **Blender API documentation** - For bpy integration validation
5. **CrewAI documentation** - For agent orchestration validation
6. **Backend API documentation** - ComfyUI, Wan2GP, LiteLLM specs
