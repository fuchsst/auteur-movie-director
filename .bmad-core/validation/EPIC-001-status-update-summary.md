### Epic Status Corrections

**Previous Epic Status:**
- Incorrectly showed STORY-018 as completed
- Incorrectly showed STORY-012 and STORY-013 as completed
- Incorrectly showed STORY-019 and STORY-020 as pending

**Corrected Epic Status:**
- Moved STORY-018 to Pending (it's not implemented)
- Moved STORY-012 and STORY-013 to Pending
- Moved STORY-019 and STORY-020 to Completed

## Final Story Count

### By Status:
- **Completed**: 14 stories (61%)
- **Not Started**: 9 stories (39%)
- **Total**: 23 stories

### By Type:
- **Infrastructure**: 8 stories (5 completed, 3 pending)
- **Backend**: 6 stories (4 completed, 2 pending)
- **Frontend**: 7 stories (5 completed, 2 pending)
- **Integration**: 2 stories (0 completed, 2 pending)

## Key Findings

1. **Status Field Coverage**: Previously only 9/23 stories had status fields. Now 23/23 (100%) have status fields.

2. **Accuracy Improvements**: Corrected 3 stories that were incorrectly marked as completed in the epic when they weren't implemented.

3. **Infrastructure Progress**: Good progress on infrastructure stories with Makefile and Docker Compose completed.

4. **Integration Gap**: Both integration stories (012 and 013) remain unimplemented, which explains some of the validation issues.

5. **Settings Confusion**: STORY-018 (Settings View) was marked as completed in the epic based on git commit messages, but actual implementation not found in codebase.

## Next Steps

1. **Priority 1**: Implement STORY-012 (End-to-End Project Flow) to ensure all components work together
2. **Priority 2**: Implement STORY-013 (Function Runner Foundation) for task execution
3. **Priority 3**: Implement STORY-015 (Progress Area) for user feedback
4. **Priority 4**: Complete remaining UI stories (016, 018)

## Notes

- All story markdown files now have consistent formatting with status fields
- The epic progress is accurately reflected as 14/23 (61%) complete
- Story points have been adjusted: 46 completed, 27 remaining
