## Architecture Notes

### Function Interface Pattern
All functions implement the standardized `FunctionInterface`:
```python
class FunctionInterface(ABC):
    async def execute(self, params: dict, quality: str, project_path: str, progress_callback: Callable) -> FunctionResult
    def get_parameter_schema(self) -> dict
    def get_backend_type(self) -> str
```

### Quality Tiers
- **Draft** (was "low"): CPU-only, fast preview
- **Standard**: GPU acceleration, balanced quality/speed
- **High**: Enhanced quality, longer processing
- **Ultra** (was "premium"): Maximum quality, professional output

### Backend Support
- **ComfyUI**: Workflow-based image/video generation
- **Gradio**: Simple API-based models
- **Custom**: Direct script execution

## Notes

- Stories are designed to be independently deliverable where possible
- Foundation story (STORY-013) provides the base infrastructure
- Template system enables rapid function addition without code changes
- Quality abstraction simplifies user experience
- Comprehensive testing ensures production readiness
- Point estimates follow: Small (1-5), Medium (7-8), Large (10+)
