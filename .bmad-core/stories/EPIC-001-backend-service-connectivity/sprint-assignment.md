## Resource Allocation

### Developer Roles

**Backend Lead**:
- Primary: Core connectivity components (001, 002, 009, 011)
- Secondary: Code reviews, architecture decisions
- ~30 story points

**Backend Developer 2**:
- Primary: Service clients and health (003, 010, 013, 014)
- Secondary: Integration testing support
- ~24 story points

**Backend Developer 3** (if available):
- Primary: HTTP client and registry (004, 012)
- Secondary: Testing and documentation
- ~13 story points

**Frontend Developer**:
- Primary: All UI components (005, 006, 007, 008)
- Secondary: UI testing and polish
- ~18 story points

**QA/DevOps** (part-time):
- Primary: Test frameworks (015, 016)
- Secondary: CI/CD setup
- ~13 story points

## Sprint Planning Considerations

### Sprint 1 Risks
- Service discovery complexity might require more time
- UI developers need mock data while backends are built

**Mitigation**: Create mock service responses early

### Sprint 2 Risks  
- Three different client implementations in parallel
- Testing complexity with multiple protocols

**Mitigation**: Daily sync meetings, shared testing utilities

### Sprint 3 Risks
- Connection pool complexity
- Performance requirements

**Mitigation**: Early performance testing, simple pool first

### Sprint 4 Risks
- Reconnection edge cases
- Integration test environment complexity

**Mitigation**: Comprehensive error scenarios, Docker expertise

## Success Criteria Per Sprint

## Adjustments and Flexibility

### If Ahead of Schedule
- Add more integration test scenarios
- Implement advanced monitoring features
- Start on next epic's foundation work
- Improve documentation and examples

### If Behind Schedule  
- Defer STORY-008 (Health Dashboard) to next epic
- Simplify STORY-012 (Service Registry) 
- Reduce integration test scope
- Focus on critical path stories

### Team Availability Issues
- Frontend dev out: Backend devs take simple UI stories
- Backend dev out: Extend sprints, reduce parallelization
- QA out: Developers write own tests, defer integration tests

## Communication Plan

### Daily Standups
- Focus on dependencies and blockers
- Coordinate integration points
- Share testing strategies

### Sprint Planning
- Review dependencies before assignment
- Ensure critical path coverage
- Plan for integration time

### Sprint Reviews
- Demo working connections
- Show UI progress
- Run test suites
- Get stakeholder feedback
