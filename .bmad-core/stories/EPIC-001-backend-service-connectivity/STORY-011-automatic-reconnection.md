## Implementation Notes

### Technical Approach

**Reconnection Manager:**
```python
from enum import Enum
import asyncio
from typing import Dict, Optional, Callable

class ConnectionState(Enum):
    CONNECTED = "connected"
    DISCONNECTED = "disconnected"
    RECONNECTING = "reconnecting"
    FAILED = "failed"
    SUSPENDED = "suspended"

class ReconnectionManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.connection_states: Dict[str, ConnectionState] = {}
        self.retry_policies: Dict[str, RetryPolicy] = {}
        self.circuit_breakers: Dict[str, CircuitBreaker] = {}
        self.pending_operations: Dict[str, OperationQueue] = {}
        self.reconnection_tasks: Dict[str, asyncio.Task] = {}
        
    async def handle_disconnection(self, service: str, error: Exception):
        """Handle service disconnection event"""
        logger.info(f"Service {service} disconnected: {error}")
        
        # Update state
        self.connection_states[service] = ConnectionState.DISCONNECTED
        
        # Check circuit breaker
        breaker = self.circuit_breakers[service]
        if breaker.is_open():
            logger.warning(f"Circuit breaker open for {service}")
            self.connection_states[service] = ConnectionState.SUSPENDED
            return
            
        # Start reconnection if not already running
        if service not in self.reconnection_tasks:
            task = asyncio.create_task(
                self._reconnection_loop(service)
            )
            self.reconnection_tasks[service] = task
```

**Exponential Backoff Implementation:**
```python
class RetryPolicy:
    def __init__(self, 
                 initial_delay: float = 1.0,
                 max_delay: float = 60.0,
                 multiplier: float = 2.0,
                 max_attempts: int = 10):
        self.initial_delay = initial_delay
        self.max_delay = max_delay
        self.multiplier = multiplier
        self.max_attempts = max_attempts
        self.current_delay = initial_delay
        self.attempt_count = 0
        
    def get_next_delay(self) -> Optional[float]:
        """Get next retry delay or None if exhausted"""
        if self.attempt_count >= self.max_attempts:
            return None
            
        delay = min(self.current_delay, self.max_delay)
        
        # Add jitter to prevent thundering herd
        jitter = random.uniform(0, delay * 0.1)
        delay += jitter
        
        # Update for next attempt
        self.current_delay *= self.multiplier
        self.attempt_count += 1
        
        return delay
        
    def reset(self):
        """Reset retry policy after successful connection"""
        self.current_delay = self.initial_delay
        self.attempt_count = 0
```

**Reconnection Loop:**
```python
async def _reconnection_loop(self, service: str):
    """Reconnection loop with exponential backoff"""
    policy = self.retry_policies[service]
    
    while True:
        # Update state
        self.connection_states[service] = ConnectionState.RECONNECTING
        
        # Get next delay
        delay = policy.get_next_delay()
        if delay is None:
            # Max attempts reached
            self.connection_states[service] = ConnectionState.FAILED
            await self._notify_reconnection_failed(service)
            break
            
        # Wait before retry
        logger.info(f"Reconnecting {service} in {delay:.1f}s (attempt {policy.attempt_count})")
        await asyncio.sleep(delay)
        
        try:
            # Attempt reconnection
            success = await self._attempt_reconnection(service)
            
            if success:
                # Reset policy
                policy.reset()
                self.connection_states[service] = ConnectionState.CONNECTED
                
                # Resume operations
                await self._resume_operations(service)
                
                # Notify success
                await self._notify_reconnection_success(service)
                break
                
        except Exception as e:
            logger.error(f"Reconnection failed for {service}: {e}")
            
            # Record failure in circuit breaker
            self.circuit_breakers[service].record_failure()
            
    # Clean up task reference
    self.reconnection_tasks.pop(service, None)
```

**Circuit Breaker Pattern:**
```python
class CircuitBreaker:
    def __init__(self,
                 failure_threshold: int = 5,
                 timeout: float = 300.0):  # 5 minutes
        self.failure_threshold = failure_threshold
        self.timeout = timeout
        self.failure_count = 0
        self.last_failure_time = 0
        self.state = 'closed'  # closed, open, half-open
        
    def record_failure(self):
        """Record a connection failure"""
        self.failure_count += 1
        self.last_failure_time = time.time()
        
        if self.failure_count >= self.failure_threshold:
            self.state = 'open'
            logger.warning(f"Circuit breaker opened after {self.failure_count} failures")
            
    def record_success(self):
        """Record a successful connection"""
        self.failure_count = 0
        self.state = 'closed'
        
    def is_open(self) -> bool:
        """Check if circuit breaker is open"""
        if self.state == 'closed':
            return False
            
        # Check if timeout has passed
        if time.time() - self.last_failure_time > self.timeout:
            self.state = 'half-open'
            return False
            
        return True
```

**Operation Queue Management:**
```python
class OperationQueue:
    def __init__(self, service: str, max_size: int = 1000):
        self.service = service
        self.queue = asyncio.Queue(maxsize=max_size)
        self.suspended = False
        
    async def enqueue(self, operation: Dict):
        """Add operation to queue during disconnection"""
        if self.suspended:
            raise QueueSuspendedError(f"Queue suspended for {self.service}")
            
        try:
            await self.queue.put(operation)
        except asyncio.QueueFull:
            raise QueueFullError(f"Operation queue full for {self.service}")
            
    async def resume(self, executor: Callable):
        """Resume queued operations after reconnection"""
        self.suspended = False
        processed = 0
        
        while not self.queue.empty():
            try:
                operation = await self.queue.get()
                await executor(operation)
                processed += 1
                
            except Exception as e:
                logger.error(f"Error resuming operation: {e}")
                # Re-queue failed operation
                await self.queue.put(operation)
                break
                
        logger.info(f"Resumed {processed} operations for {self.service}")
```

**Connection Validation:**
```python
async def _attempt_reconnection(self, service: str) -> bool:
    """Attempt to reconnect to a service"""
    try:
        # Get connection function for service
        connector = self.get_service_connector(service)
        
        # Attempt connection
        connection = await connector()
        
        # Validate connection
        if await self._validate_connection(service, connection):
            # Store connection in pool
            pool = self.connection_pools[service]
            await pool.add_connection(connection)
            
            return True
        else:
            # Invalid connection
            await connection.close()
            return False
            
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Connection attempt failed: {e}")
        return False
        
async def _validate_connection(self, service: str, connection) -> bool:
    """Validate that connection is functional"""
    validator = self.connection_validators.get(service)
    if not validator:
        return True  # No validator, assume OK
        
    try:
        return await validator(connection)
    except:
        return False
```

### Blender UI Integration
```python
class MOVIE_DIRECTOR_OT_manual_reconnect(Operator):
    bl_idname = "movie_director.manual_reconnect"
    bl_label = "Reconnect Service"
    
    service: StringProperty()
    
    def execute(self, context):
        # Trigger manual reconnection
        asyncio.create_task(
            reconnection_manager.manual_reconnect(self.service)
        )
        self.report({'INFO'}, f"Reconnecting to {self.service}...")
        return {'FINISHED'}
```
