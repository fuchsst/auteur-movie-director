# EPIC-001: Backend Service Connectivity - User Stories

This directory contains the complete breakdown of EPIC-001 into 16 implementable user stories, following the BMAD Development Lead framework.

## Overview

EPIC-001 establishes the foundational communication layer between the Blender Movie Director addon and all AI generation backends. This epic transforms the addon from a static UI prototype into a live system capable of discovering, connecting to, and maintaining stable connections with local AI services.

## Total Story Points: 91

## Story Relationships

The stories have specific dependencies that should guide implementation order:

```
Foundation Layer (Sprint 1-2)
├── STORY-001: Service Discovery ──┐
├── STORY-002: WebSocket Client ───┼─→ STORY-009: Connection Pool
├── STORY-003: Gradio Client ──────┤
└── STORY-004: HTTP Client ────────┘

UI Layer (Sprint 2-3)
├── STORY-005: Status Panel ───────→ STORY-008: Health Dashboard
├── STORY-006: Configuration UI
└── STORY-007: Error Notifications

Backend Services (Sprint 3-4)
├── STORY-010: Health Check ───────→ STORY-011: Auto Reconnection
└── STORY-012: Service Registry

Data & Testing (Sprint 4-5)
├── STORY-013: State Persistence
├── STORY-014: Config Model
├── STORY-015: Unit Tests
└── STORY-016: Integration Tests
```

## Implementation Guidelines

### Development Approach
1. **Test-Driven Development**: Write tests (STORY-015) alongside implementation
2. **Incremental Integration**: Test each component as it's completed
3. **UI-First Demo**: Show progress through visible UI changes
4. **Documentation**: Update as you code, not after

### Technical Standards
- **Async/Await**: All backend operations must be asynchronous
- **Thread Safety**: Connection pool and shared resources must be thread-safe
- **Error Handling**: Every network operation needs timeout and error handling
- **Logging**: Comprehensive logging for debugging connection issues

### Quality Checkpoints
- After Foundation Stories: Basic connectivity working
- After UI Stories: User can see and configure connections
- After Backend Stories: Robust connection management
- After Testing Stories: Production-ready reliability

## Success Metrics

### Sprint Velocity
- Target: 18-22 story points per 2-week sprint
- Critical path: Stories 1-4, 9-11 must complete first

### Quality Metrics
- Unit test coverage: >90%
- Integration test success: >95%
- Connection reliability: >99.9%
- Reconnection success: <90 seconds

### Performance Targets
- Service discovery: <5 seconds
- Connection establishment: <2 seconds
- Health check cycle: <30 seconds
- UI responsiveness: <100ms

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
1. **WebSocket Compatibility**: Have HTTP fallback ready
2. **Thread Safety**: Extensive concurrent testing
3. **Network Issues**: Robust retry and timeout logic

### Schedule Risks
1. **Backend Availability**: Mock implementations for development
2. **Complex Integration**: Start integration tests early
3. **UI Performance**: Profile and optimize regularly

## Next Steps

1. **Sprint Planning**: Assign stories to sprints based on dependencies
2. **Team Assignment**: Match expertise to story requirements
3. **Environment Setup**: Prepare development backends
4. **Kickoff Meeting**: Review stories with full team
