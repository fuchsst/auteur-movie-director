# EPIC-002 Story Summary: Project & Asset Management System

## Overview
This epic contains 15 stories (including the partially complete STORY-021) totaling 76 story points. The stories are organized into 5 logical groups that can be developed in sequence with some parallelization opportunities.

## Story Groups and Dependencies

### Group 1: Project Foundation (18 points) - Sprint 1-2
These stories establish the core project structure and must be completed first.

| Story ID | Title | Points | Dependencies | Priority |
|----------|-------|--------|--------------|----------|
| STORY-025 | Project Scaffolding Service | 5 | EPIC-001 stories | Critical |
| STORY-026 | Git Integration | 5 | STORY-025 | Critical |
| STORY-027 | Project API Endpoints | 3 | STORY-025, STORY-026 | High |
| STORY-028 | Project Browser UI | 5 | STORY-027 | High |

### Group 2: Asset Management (18 points) - Sprint 3-4
Can begin after STORY-025 is complete. Some parallel work possible with Group 1.

| Story ID | Title | Points | Dependencies | Priority |
|----------|-------|--------|--------------|----------|
| STORY-029 | Workspace Asset Service | 5 | File operations (EPIC-001) | High |
| STORY-030 | Asset Browser Component | 8 | STORY-029 | High |
| STORY-031 | Asset Operations | 5 | STORY-029, STORY-025 | High |

### Group 3: Takes System (13 points) - Sprint 5-6
Depends on project foundation being complete.

| Story ID | Title | Points | Dependencies | Priority |
|----------|-------|--------|--------------|----------|
| STORY-021 | Takes Service | 5 | ✅ Partially Complete | High |
| STORY-032 | Takes Gallery UI | 5 | STORY-021 | High |
| STORY-033 | Takes Integration | 3 | STORY-021, STORY-026 | High |

### Group 4: Git Operations (16 points) - Sprint 7-8
Advanced features building on basic Git integration.

| Story ID | Title | Points | Dependencies | Priority |
|----------|-------|--------|--------------|----------|
| STORY-034 | Git Service Extensions | 5 | STORY-026 | Medium |
| STORY-035 | Git UI Components | 8 | STORY-034 | Medium |
| STORY-036 | Git Performance | 3 | STORY-034 | Medium |

### Group 5: Import/Export (11 points) - Sprint 9-10
Can be developed last as it depends on all core functionality.

| Story ID | Title | Points | Dependencies | Priority |
|----------|-------|--------|--------------|----------|
| STORY-037 | Project Export | 5 | Groups 1-3 complete | Medium |
| STORY-038 | Project Import | 6 | STORY-037, migration framework | Medium |

## Sprint Allocation Recommendation

### Sprint 1 (Week 1-2): Foundation - 18 points
- STORY-025: Project Scaffolding Service (5)
- STORY-026: Git Integration (5)
- STORY-027: Project API Endpoints (3)
- STORY-028: Project Browser UI (5)

### Sprint 2 (Week 3-4): Assets - 18 points
- STORY-029: Workspace Asset Service (5)
- STORY-030: Asset Browser Component (8)
- STORY-031: Asset Operations (5)

### Sprint 3 (Week 5-6): Takes - 13 points
- Complete STORY-021: Takes Service (remaining work ~2)
- STORY-032: Takes Gallery UI (5)
- STORY-033: Takes Integration (3)
- Buffer for polish/fixes (3)

### Sprint 4 (Week 7-8): Git Advanced - 16 points
- STORY-034: Git Service Extensions (5)
- STORY-035: Git UI Components (8)
- STORY-036: Git Performance (3)

### Sprint 5 (Week 9-10): Import/Export - 11 points
- STORY-037: Project Export (5)
- STORY-038: Project Import (6)

## Technical Patterns

### Backend Services
All backend stories follow a consistent service pattern:
- Service class in `backend/app/services/`
- RESTful API endpoints
- Pydantic schemas for validation
- Comprehensive error handling
- WebSocket notifications for long operations

### Frontend Components
UI stories use consistent patterns:
- SvelteKit components in appropriate directories
- Reactive stores for state management
- WebSocket integration for real-time updates
- Responsive design with mobile support
- Keyboard shortcuts and accessibility

### Testing Strategy
Each story includes:
- Unit tests (>80% coverage target)
- Integration tests for workflows
- Performance tests where applicable
- UI components include visual tests

## Risk Mitigation

### Critical Path
Stories 025 → 026 → 027 form the critical path. Any delays here impact the entire epic.

### Technical Risks
1. **Git Performance**: Addressed specifically in STORY-036
2. **Large File Handling**: Mitigated by Git LFS integration
3. **Concurrent Access**: File locking strategy in multiple stories

### Integration Risks
- Canvas integration explicitly out of scope (PRD-004)
- AI execution not included (PRD-003)
- Clear boundaries prevent scope creep

## Success Criteria Tracking
The epic's acceptance criteria can be mapped to specific stories:
- Project creation < 5 seconds: STORY-025
- Visual project browser: STORY-028
- Asset browser and operations: STORY-029, 030, 031
- Takes gallery: STORY-032
- Git timeline: STORY-035
- Import/Export: STORY-037, 038

## Notes for Development Lead
1. STORY-021 (Takes Service) is partially complete - assess remaining work early
2. Consider parallel frontend/backend work in each sprint
3. Git performance optimization can be deferred if needed
4. Import/Export can be moved to a future release if timeline is tight
5. Each story group is relatively independent after dependencies are met
