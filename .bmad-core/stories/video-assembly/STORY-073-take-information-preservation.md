# User Story: STORY-073 - Take Information Preservation

## Story Description
**As a** filmmaker
**I want** take information and generation parameters preserved in the assembly process
**So that** I can maintain complete creative history and reproduce shots if needed

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- [ ] Extract take metadata from project.json
- [ ] Include generation parameters (prompts, seeds, models)
- [ ] Preserve take selection history
- [ ] Store creative parameters in EDL comments
- [ ] Link takes to final output files
- [ ] Generate take summary reports

### Technical Requirements
- [ ] Take metadata extraction service
- [ ] Parameter serialization to EDL format
- [ ] Database integration for take tracking
- [ ] File linking between takes and outputs
- [ ] JSON sidecar file generation
- [ ] Hash verification for take integrity

### Quality Requirements
- [ ] Unit tests for take extraction
- [ ] Integration tests for parameter preservation
- [ ] Round-trip testing (take → assembly → take)
- [ ] Data integrity verification tests
- [ ] Performance tests for large take counts

## Implementation Notes

### Take Metadata Structure
```python
class TakeMetadata:
    take_id: str
    shot_id: str
    generation_params: dict
    prompt: str
    seed: int
    model: str
    cfg_scale: float
    steps: int
    created_at: datetime
    quality_score: float
    selected: bool
```

### EDL Integration
```
* FROM CLIP NAME: Shot_001_Take3_Selected
* COMMENT: Take ID: take-12345, Seed: 123456789, Model: SDXL-v1.5
* METADATA: {"prompt": "cinematic shot...", "cfg_scale": 7.5, "steps": 30}
```
