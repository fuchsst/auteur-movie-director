## Implementation Notes

### Batch Job Structure
```python
class BatchJob:
    id: str
    name: str
    jobs: List[AssemblyJob]
    priority: int
    max_concurrent: int
    status: BatchStatus
    created_at: datetime
    estimated_completion: datetime

class AssemblyJob:
    id: str
    batch_id: str
    project_id: str
    configuration: ExportConfig
    priority: int
    dependencies: List[str]
```

### Processing Orchestration
```python
class BatchProcessor:
    def __init__(self, max_concurrent=4):
        self.job_queue = PriorityQueue()
        self.active_jobs = {}
        self.max_concurrent = max_concurrent
    
    def process_batch(self, batch_job: BatchJob):
        # Sort jobs by priority and dependencies
        sorted_jobs = self.sort_jobs_by_priority(batch_job.jobs)
        
        # Process jobs with concurrency limits
        with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=self.max_concurrent) as executor:
            futures = []
            for job in sorted_jobs:
                if self.can_start_job(job):
                    future = executor.submit(self.process_single_job, job)
                    futures.append(future)
            
            # Monitor and collect results
            return self.collect_results(futures)
```

### Batch API Endpoints
```python
# POST /api/v1/batch/jobs
{
    "name": "MyFilm_Multiple_Deliverables",
    "jobs": [
        {
            "project_id": "proj-123",
            "formats": ["mp4", "mov", "webm"],
            "quality": "master"
        }
    ],
    "priority": "high",
    "max_concurrent": 3
}
```

### Batch Progress Tracking
```python
class BatchProgressTracker:
    def get_batch_progress(self, batch_id: str) -> dict:
        batch = self.get_batch(batch_id)
        total_jobs = len(batch.jobs)
        completed_jobs = len([j for j in batch.jobs if j.status == "completed"])
        failed_jobs = len([j for j in batch.jobs if j.status == "failed"])
        
        return {
            "progress": (completed_jobs / total_jobs) * 100,
            "completed": completed_jobs,
            "failed": failed_jobs,
            "pending": total_jobs - completed_jobs - failed_jobs,
            "estimated_completion": self.calculate_eta(batch)
        }
```
