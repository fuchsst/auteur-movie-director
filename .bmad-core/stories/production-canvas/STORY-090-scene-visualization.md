# STORY-090: Scene-by-Scene Breakdown Visualization

## Story Overview
As a **film director**, I want **comprehensive scene visualization** so that I can **understand the complete production requirements for each scene** including story beats, character arcs, asset usage, and cost analysis.

## Business Value
- **Enhanced Decision Making**: Directors can make informed decisions about scene complexity and resource allocation
- **Production Planning**: Clear visualization of scene requirements enables better crew scheduling and budget management
- **Story Flow Understanding**: Visual representation of story beats helps maintain narrative consistency
- **Asset Optimization**: Identify asset reuse opportunities across scenes to reduce production costs
- **Collaborative Review**: Shareable visual breakdowns facilitate team communication and feedback

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Criteria
- [ ] Timeline view showing scene progression with element placement
- [ ] Story beat visualization with Dan Harmon's Story Circle integration
- [ ] Character arc tracking dashboard per scene
- [ ] Asset usage analytics with cost breakdown by category
- [ ] Interactive scene statistics and complexity metrics
- [ ] Exportable visual reports (PDF, PNG, JSON)
- [ ] Responsive design for desktop and tablet viewing
- [ ] Real-time updates when breakdown data changes

### Technical Criteria
- [ ] Performance: <100ms render time for complex scenes (100+ elements)
- [ ] Scalability: Handle scenes with 200+ elements efficiently
- [ ] Memory: <50MB memory usage for visualization components
- [ ] Responsive: 60 FPS UI during interactions
- [ ] Accessibility: Keyboard navigation and screen reader support
- [ ] Cross-browser: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge compatibility
- [ ] Error handling: Graceful fallback for missing data

### Integration Criteria
- [ ] Seamless integration with existing breakdown system
- [ ] WebSocket updates for real-time data synchronization
- [ ] Export integration with STORY-093 pipeline
- [ ] Asset propagation system compatibility (STORY-089)
- [ ] Digital table read integration (STORY-088)

## Technical Architecture

### Core Components
1. **SceneVisualization**: Main visualization container component
2. **TimelineView**: Chronological scene progression display
3. **StoryBeatsPanel**: Story circle beat visualization
4. **CharacterArcsPanel**: Character development tracking
5. **AssetAnalytics**: Cost and usage analysis dashboard

### Data Flow
```
Scene Data → SceneVisualization → Tab Views → Export Pipeline
                ↓
        Timeline → Beats → Characters → Assets → Analytics
```

### Integration Points
- **BreakdownStore**: Scene data management
- **AssetStore**: Asset tracking and metadata
- **WebSocketService**: Real-time updates
- **ExportService**: Report generation
- **ProjectStore**: Project-level data access
