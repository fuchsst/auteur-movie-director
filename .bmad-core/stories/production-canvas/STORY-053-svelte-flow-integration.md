# Story: Svelte Flow Integration & Basic Canvas

**Story ID**: STORY-053  
**Epic**: EPIC-004-production-canvas  
**Type**: Foundation  
**Points**: 8 (Large)  
**Priority**: Critical  
**Status**: ðŸ”² Not Started  

## Story Description

As a developer, I want to integrate Svelte Flow into the Auteur Movie Director frontend so that we have a solid foundation for the visual node-based Production Canvas interface, with basic canvas functionality and extensible node architecture.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Core Integration
- [ ] Install and configure @xyflow/svelte package
- [ ] Set up basic canvas component with proper initialization
- [ ] Implement canvas viewport management (zoom, pan, fit-to-screen)
- [ ] Create extensible node registration system
- [ ] Implement basic edge/connection system

### Node Architecture
- [ ] Create base node component with standardized styling
- [ ] Implement custom node types registry system
- [ ] Set up typed socket system for connections
- [ ] Create node library/drag-and-drop system
- [ ] Implement node creation/deletion workflows

### Canvas Management
- [ ] Implement responsive canvas sizing
- [ ] Add minimap for navigation
- [ ] Create zoom/reset controls
- [ ] Implement canvas state persistence
- [ ] Add undo/redo foundation

### Technical Requirements
- [ ] Type-safe node definitions
- [ ] Performance optimization for 100+ nodes
- [ ] Proper error boundaries for canvas errors
- [ ] Accessibility features (keyboard navigation)
- [ ] Mobile touch support

### Integration Points
- [ ] Connect to project.json for persistence
- [ ] Integrate with WebSocket for real-time updates
- [ ] Use EPIC-001 project structure for data storage
- [ ] Follow EPIC-002 asset system for node connections

## Implementation Notes

### Technical Architecture
```typescript
// Core canvas component structure
interface CanvasConfig {
  nodes: Node[];
  edges: Edge[];
  viewport: Viewport;
  onNodesChange: (changes: NodeChange[]) => void;
  onEdgesChange: (changes: EdgeChange[]) => void;
}

// Base node interface
interface BaseNodeData {
  label: string;
  type: string;
  position: { x: number; y: number };
  inputs?: NodeInput[];
  outputs?: NodeOutput[];
}
```

### Dependencies
- **EPIC-001**: Web platform foundation for project persistence
- **EPIC-002**: Asset system for node data connections
- **EPIC-003**: Function runner for generation capabilities

### Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for canvas component
- Integration tests for node interactions
- Performance benchmarks for large graphs
- E2E tests for basic canvas workflows

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Canvas loads with basic functionality
- [ ] Node creation/deletion works smoothly
- [ ] Performance meets 60 FPS target
- [ ] Integration tests pass
- [ ] Documentation updated
