```python
# Quality-Based Pipeline Configuration
QUALITY_PIPELINES = {
    "low": {"vram_target": 4, "steps": 15, "guidance": 7.0},
    "standard": {"vram_target": 8, "steps": 25, "guidance": 7.5},
    "high": {"vram_target": 12, "steps": 35, "guidance": 8.0}, 
    "premium": {"vram_target": 16, "steps": 50, "guidance": 8.5}
}
```

**Key Capabilities**:
