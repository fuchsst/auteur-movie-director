# Development Environment Implementation Summary

## Story Completion: STORY-001-development-environment-setup

This document summarizes the implementation of the development environment setup for the Auteur Movie Director project.

### What Was Implemented

#### 1. Project Structure
Created the complete project structure as defined in the story:
- `backend/` - FastAPI application
- `frontend/` - SvelteKit application  
- `scripts/` - Setup and utility scripts
- `docs/` - Documentation
- `workspace/` - User projects directory

#### 2. Setup Scripts
Implemented all required setup scripts in the `scripts/` directory:

- **setup.js** - Main setup orchestrator that runs all setup steps
- **check-prerequisites.js** - Verifies system requirements (Node.js 18+, Python 3.11+, Git)
- **setup-env.js** - Creates .env files from templates
- **setup-deps.js** - Installs all dependencies (npm and pip)
- **validate-env.js** - Validates the environment configuration

#### 3. Environment Configuration
Created comprehensive environment templates:

- **.env.example** - Main configuration template
- **backend/.env.template** - Backend-specific settings
- **frontend/.env.template** - Frontend-specific settings

All templates include:
- Service endpoints
- Development settings
- API configuration
- VRAM management settings
- Git configuration

#### 4. Docker Configuration
- **docker-compose.yml** - Defines all AI services (ComfyUI, Wan2GP, RVC, AudioLDM)
- GPU support with NVIDIA runtime
- Health checks for all services
- Volume management for models and outputs

#### 5. npm Scripts
Updated `package.json` with all required scripts:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "setup": "node scripts/setup.js",
    "setup:check": "node scripts/check-prerequisites.js",
    "setup:deps": "node scripts/setup-deps.js",
    "setup:env": "node scripts/setup-env.js",
    "validate": "node scripts/validate-env.js",
    "dev": "concurrently \"npm:dev:*\"",
    "dev:backend": "cd backend && uvicorn app.main:app --reload",
    "dev:frontend": "cd frontend && npm run dev",
    // ... and many more
  }
}
```

#### 6. Frontend Setup
Created basic SvelteKit structure:
- Vite configuration
- Svelte configuration
- TypeScript setup
- Basic routes and components
- Prettier and ESLint configuration

#### 7. Documentation
- **docs/SETUP.md** - Comprehensive setup guide
- Updated README.md with quick start instructions
- Platform-specific notes and troubleshooting

### Acceptance Criteria Met

✅ **Functional Requirements**
- Running `npm run setup` completes successfully
- Setup script checks for required prerequisites
- Environment variables are properly configured from templates
- Both frontend and backend dependencies can be installed
- Development servers can be started with `npm run dev`

✅ **Technical Requirements**
- Created `.env.template` files for all components
- Implemented all setup scripts in `scripts/` directory
- Configured npm scripts in root `package.json`
- Added prerequisite checking with clear error messages
- Supports both npm and pnpm package managers

✅ **Documentation Requirements**
- Updated README.md with quick start instructions
- Documented all available npm scripts
- Included troubleshooting section
- Added platform-specific notes

### How to Use

1. **Quick Setup**
   ```bash
   npm run setup
   ```

2. **Start Development**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Validate Environment**
   ```bash
   npm run validate
   ```

### Next Steps

The development environment is now ready for:
- Frontend development with SvelteKit
- Backend development with FastAPI
- Integration with AI services via Docker
- Real-time collaboration features
- Production canvas implementation

### Testing the Setup

To verify everything is working:

1. Run `npm run setup:check` - Should show all prerequisites installed
2. Run `npm run setup:env` - Should create all .env files
3. Run `npm run validate` - Should show environment is configured
4. Run `npm run dev` - Should start both frontend and backend servers

The implementation is complete and ready for development!
